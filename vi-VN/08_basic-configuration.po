msgid "Working with foreign languages often implied regular switches between various encodings and character sets. Furthermore, writing multilingual documents led to further, almost intractable problems. Unicode (a super-catalog of nearly all writing systems from all of the world's languages) was created to work around this problem. One of Unicode's encodings, UTF-8, retains all 128 ASCII symbols (7-bit codes), but handles other characters differently. Those are preceded by a specific escape sequence of a few bits, which implicitly defines the length of the character. This allows encoding all Unicode characters on a sequence of one or more bytes. Its use has been popularized by the fact that it is the default encoding in XML documents."

msgstr ""

msgid "The generalization of UTF-8 encoding has been a long awaited solution to numerous difficulties with interoperability, since it facilitates international exchange and removes the arbitrary limits on characters that can be used in a document. The one drawback is that it had to go through a rather difficult transition phase. Since it could not be completely transparent (that is, it could not happen at the same time all over the world), two conversion operations were required: one on file contents, and the other on filenames. Fortunately, the bulk of this migration has been completed and we discuss it largely for reference."

msgstr ""

msgid "When a text is sent (or stored) without encoding information, it is not always possible for the recipient to know with certainty what convention to use for determining the meaning of a set of bytes. You can usually get an idea by getting statistics on the distribution of values present in the text, but that doesn't always give a definite answer. When the encoding system chosen for reading differs from that used in writing the file, the bytes are mis-interpreted, and you get, at best, errors on some characters, or, at worst, something completely illegible."
msgstr ""

msgid "Thus, if a French text appears normal with the exception of accented letters and certain symbols which appear to be replaced with sequences of characters like “Ã©” or Ã¨” or “Ã§”, it is probably a file encoded as UTF-8 but interpreted as ISO-8859-1 or ISO-8859-15. This is a sign of a local installation that has not yet been migrated to UTF-8. If, instead, you see question marks instead of accented letters — even if these question marks seem to also replace a character that should have followed the accented letter — it is likely that your installation is already configured for UTF-8 and that you have been sent a document encoded in Western ISO."
msgstr ""

msgid "So much for “simple” cases. These cases only appear in Western culture, since Unicode (and UTF-8) was designed to maximize the common points with historical encodings for Western languages based on the Latin alphabet, which allows recognition of parts of the text even when some characters are missing."
msgstr ""

msgid "In more complex configurations, which, for example, involve two environments corresponding to two different languages that do not use the same alphabet, you often get completely illegible results — a series of abstract symbols that have nothing to do with each other. This is especially common with Asian languages due to their numerous languages and writing systems. The Japanese word <foreignphrase>mojibake</foreignphrase> has been adopted to describe this phenomenon. When it appears, diagnosis is more complex and the simplest solution is often to simply migrate to UTF-8 on both sides."
msgstr ""

msgid "As far as file names are concerned, the migration can be relatively simple. The <command>convmv</command> tool (in the package with the same name) was created specifically for this purpose; it allows renaming files from one encoding to another. The use of this tool is relatively simple, but we recommend doing it in two steps to avoid surprises.

The operating system kernel has its own, the software clock, which it keeps up to date with its own means (possibly with the help of time servers, see <xref linkend=\"sect.time-synchronization\" />). This system clock is generally more accurate, especially since it doesn't need access to hardware variables. However, since it only exists in live memory, it is zeroed out every time the machine is booted, contrary to the CMOS clock, which has a battery and therefore “survives” rebooting or halting of the machine. The system clock is, thus, set from the CMOS clock during boot, and the CMOS clock is updated on shutdown (to take into account possible changes or corrections if it has been improperly adjusted)."

There is a choice to make regarding its interpretation: either the system considers it runs in universal time (UTC, formerly GMT), or in local time. This choice could be a simple shift, but things are actually more complicated: as a result of daylight saving time, this offset is not constant. The result is that the system has no way to determine whether the offset is correct, especially around periods of time change. Since it is always possible to reconstruct local time from universal time and the timezone information, we strongly recommend using the CMOS clock in universal time."

But when a computer has several systems (whether it be a “dual-boot” configuration or running other systems via virtual machine), chaos ensues, with no means to determine if the time is correct. If you absolutely must retain Windows on a computer, you should either configure it to keep the CMOS clock as UTC (setting the registry key <literal>HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\TimeZoneInformation\\RealTimeIsUniversal</literal> to “1” as a DWORD), or use <command>hwclock --localtime --set</command> on the Debian system to set the hardware clock and mark it as tracking the local time (and make sure to manually check your clock in spring and autumn)."

msgid "Some modules are maintained outside of the official Linux kernel. To use them, they must be compiled alongside the matching kernel. A number of common third party modules are provided by Debian in dedicated packages, such as <emphasis role=\"pkg\">xtables-addons-source</emphasis> (extra modules for iptables) or <emphasis role=\"pkg\">oss4-source</emphasis> (Open Sound System, some alternative audio drivers)."
msgstr ""

msgid "These external packages are many and varied and we won't list them all here; the <command>apt-cache search source$</command> command can narrow down the search field. However, a complete list isn't particularly useful since there is no particular reason for compiling external modules except when you know you need it. In such cases, the device's documentation will typically detail the specific module(s) it needs to function under Linux."
msgstr ""

msgid "For example, let's look at the <emphasis role=\"pkg\">xtables-addons-source</emphasis> package: after installation, a <filename>.tar.bz2</filename> of the module's sources is stored in <filename>/usr/src/</filename>. While we could manually extract the tarball and build the module, in practice we prefer to automate all this using DKMS. Most modules offer the required DKMS integration in a package ending with a <literal>-dkms</literal> suffix. In our case, installing <emphasis role=\"pkg\">xtables-addons-dkms</emphasis> is all that is needed to compile the kernel module for the current kernel provided that we have the <emphasis role=\"pkg\">linux-headers-*</emphasis> package matching the installed kernel. For instance, if you use <emphasis role=\"pkg\">linux-image-amd64</emphasis>, you would also install <emphasis role=\"pkg\">linux-headers-amd64</emphasis>."

The symbols table helps developers understand the meaning of a kernel error message; without it, kernel “oopses” (an “oops” is the kernel equivalent of a segmentation fault for user-space programs, in other words messages generated following an invalid pointer dereference) only contain numeric memory addresses, which is useless information without the table mapping these addresses to symbols and function names.

Finally, the post-installation scripts update the symbolic links <filename>/vmlinuz</filename>, <filename>/vmlinuz.old</filename>, <filename>/initrd.img</filename> and <filename>/initrd.img.old</filename> so that they point to the latest two kernels installed, respectively, as well as the corresponding initrd images."
