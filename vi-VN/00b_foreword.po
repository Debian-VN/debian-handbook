msgstr "Lời tựa"

msgid "Linux has been garnering strength for a number of years now, and its growing popularity drives more and more users to make the jump. The first step on that path is to pick a distribution. This is an important decision, because each distribution has its own peculiarities, and future migration costs can be avoided if the right choice is made from the start."
msgstr "Trong những năm qua, Linux ngày càng khẳng định được sức mạnh của mình. Sự phổ biến của nó khiến nhiều người dùng có sự chuyển đổi. Họ bắt đầu lựa chọn một trong số những distribution (bản phân phối) của Linux. Đó là một quyết định rất quan trọng, bởi vì mỗi distribution đều có những đặc điểm riêng của nó, đồng thời nếu có sự lựa chọn đúng đắn ngay từ đầu sẽ đem lại lợi ích to lớn trong tương lai."

msgid "Most Linux distributions are backed by a for-profit company that develops them and sells them under some kind of commercial scheme. Examples include <emphasis>Ubuntu</emphasis>, mainly developed by <emphasis>Canonical Ltd.</emphasis>; <emphasis>Mandriva Linux</emphasis>, by French company <emphasis>Mandriva SA</emphasis>; and <emphasis>Suse Linux</emphasis>, maintained and made commercially available by <emphasis>Novell</emphasis>."
msgstr ""

msgid "At the other end of the spectrum lie the likes of Debian and the Apache Software Foundation (which hosts the development for the Apache web server). Debian is above all a project in the Free Software world, implemented by volunteers working together through the Internet. While some of them do work on Debian as part of their paid job in various companies, the project as a whole is not attached to any company in particular, nor does any one company have a greater say in the project's affairs than what purely volunteer contributors have."
msgstr ""

msgid "Linux has gathered a fair amount of media coverage over the years; it mostly benefits the distributions supported by a real marketing department — in other words, company-backed distributions (Ubuntu, Red Hat, SUSE, Mandriva, and so on). But Debian is far from being a marginal distribution; multiple studies have shown over the years that it is widely used both on servers and on desktops. This is particularly true among webservers where Debian is the leading Linux distribution. <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"http://www.heise.de/open/artikel/Eingesetzte-Produkte-224518.html\" /> <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"http://w3techs.com/blog/entry/debian_ubuntu_extend_the_dominance_in_the_linux_web_server_market_at_the_expense_of_red_hat_centos\" />"

We hope to share the experience that we have gathered since we joined the project as developers and contributors in 1998 (Raphaël) and 2000 (Roland). With any luck, our enthusiasm will be communicative, and maybe you will join us sometime…"
msgstr ""

msgid "The first edition of this book (in 2004) served to fill a gaping hole: it was the first French-language book that focused exclusively on Debian. At that time, many other books were written on the topic both for French-speaking and English-speaking readers. Unfortunately almost none of them got updated, and over the years the situation slipped back to one where there were very few good books on Debian. We hope that this book, which has started a new life with its translation into English (and several translations from English into various other languages), will fill this gap and help many users."
msgstr ""

msgid "Who Is this Book For?"
msgstr ""

msgid "We tried to make this book useful for many categories of readers. First, systems administrators (both beginners and experienced) will find explanations about the installation and deployment of Debian on many computers. They will also get a glimpse of most of the services available on Debian, along with matching configuration instructions and a description of the specifics coming from the distribution. Understanding the mechanisms involved in Debian's development will enable them to deal with unforeseen problems, knowing that they can always find help within the community."
msgstr ""

msgid "Users of another Linux distribution, or of another Unix variant, will discover the specifics of Debian, and should become operational very quickly while benefiting fully from the unique advantages of this distribution."
msgstr ""

msgid "Finally, readers who already have some knowledge of Debian and want to know more about the community behind it should see their expectations fulfilled. This book should make them much closer to joining us as contributors."
msgstr ""

msgid "General Approach"
msgstr ""

msgid "All of the generic documentation you can find about GNU/Linux also applies to Debian, since Debian includes most common free software. However, the distribution brings many enhancements, which is why we chose to primarily describe the “Debian way” of doing things."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is interesting to follow the Debian recommendations, but it is even better to understand their rationale. Therefore, we won't restrict ourselves to practical explanations only; we will also describe the project's workings, so as to provide you with comprehensive and consistent knowledge."
msgstr ""

msgid "Book Structure"
msgstr ""

msgid "This book has its origins in French publisher Eyrolles' “Administrator's Handbook” collection, and keeps the same approach of revolving around a case study providing both support and illustration for all topics being addressed."

msgid "<emphasis>NOTE</emphasis> Web site, authors' email"
msgstr ""

msgid "This book has its own website, which hosts whatever elements that can make it more useful. In particular, it includes an online version of the book with clickable links, and possible errata. Feel free to browse it and to leave us some feedback. We will be happy to read your comments or support messages. Send them by email to <email>hertzog@debian.org</email> (Raphaël) and <email>lolando@debian.org</email> (Roland). <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"http://debian-handbook.info/\" />"

msgid "<emphasis role=\"strong\">Chapter 1</emphasis> focuses on a non-technical presentation of the Debian project and describes its goals and organization. These aspects are important because they define a general framework that other chapters will complete with more concrete information."
msgstr ""

msgid "<emphasis role=\"strong\">Chapters 2 and 3</emphasis> provide a broad outline of the case study. At this point, novice readers can take the time to read <emphasis role=\"strong\">appendix B</emphasis>, where they will find a short remedial course explaining a number of basic computing notions, as well as concepts inherent to any Unix system."
msgstr ""

msgid "To get on with our real subject matter, we will quite naturally start with the installation process (<emphasis role=\"strong\">chapter 4</emphasis>); <emphasis role=\"strong\">chapters 5 and 6</emphasis> will unveil basic tools that any Debian administrator will use, such as those of the <emphasis role=\"strong\">APT</emphasis> family, which is largely responsible for the distribution's excellent reputation. These chapters are in no way restricted to professionals, since everyone is their own administrator at home."
msgstr ""

msgid "<emphasis role=\"strong\">Chapter 7</emphasis> will be an important parenthesis; it describes workflows to efficiently use documentation and to quickly gain an understanding of problems in order to solve them."
msgstr ""

msgid "The next chapters will be a more detailed tour of the system, starting with basic infrastructure and services (<emphasis role=\"strong\">chapters 8 to 10</emphasis>) and going progressively up the stack to reach the user applications in <emphasis role=\"strong\">chapter 13</emphasis>. <emphasis role=\"strong\">Chapter 12</emphasis> deals with more advanced subjects that will most directly concern administrators of large sets of computers (including servers), while <emphasis role=\"strong\">chapter 14</emphasis> is a brief introduction to the wider subject of computer security and gives a few keys to avoid most problems."

msgid "A Debian package is an archive containing all the files required to install a piece of software. It is generally a file with a <filename>.deb</filename> extension, and it can be handled with the <command>dpkg</command> command. Also called a <emphasis>binary package</emphasis>, it contains files that can be directly used (such as programs or documentation). On the other hand, a <emphasis>source package</emphasis> contains the source code for the software and the instructions required for building the binary package."
msgstr ""

msgid "The present version is already the seventh edition of the book (we include the first four that were only available in French). This edition covers version 8 of Debian, code-named <emphasis role=\"distribution\">Jessie</emphasis>. Among the changes, Debian now sports two new architectures — <emphasis>arm64</emphasis> for 64-bit ARM processors, and <emphasis>ppc64el</emphasis> for little-endian 64-bit PowerPC processors (designed by IBM and licensed to various manufacturers via the OpenPOWER foundation). On the opposite side, some architectures have been dropped (<emphasis>sparc</emphasis>, <emphasis>ia64</emphasis>) due to lack of volunteers to keep up with development (which itself can be explained by the fact that associated hardware is getting old and less interesting to work on). Some architectures are still available (in the <emphasis role=\"distribution\">Unstable</emphasis> distribution) but did not get their <emphasis>ready for release</emphasis> stamp: <emphasis>hurd-i386</emphasis>, <emphasis>kfreebsd-i386</emphasis>, <emphasis>kfreebsd-amd64</emphasis>. All included packages have obviously been updated, including the GNOME desktop, which is now in its version 3.14. More interestingly, there are two new alternative desktops that are available: <ulink url=\"http://cinnamon.linuxmint.com/\">Cinnamon</ulink> (fork of GNOME's Shell created by and for Linux Mint) and <ulink url=\"http://mate-desktop.org/\">MATE</ulink> (continuation of the GNOME 2.x desktop)."

msgid "A Bit of History"
msgstr ""

msgid "In 2003, Nat Makarévitch contacted Raphaël because he wanted to publish a book on Debian in the <foreignphrase>Cahier de l'Admin</foreignphrase> (Admin's Handbook) collection that he was managing for Eyrolles, a leading French editor of technical books. Raphaël immediately accepted to write it. The first edition came out on 14th October 2004 and was a huge success — it was sold out barely four months later."
msgstr ""

msgid "Since then, we have released 6 other editions of the French book, one for each subsequent Debian release. Roland, who started working on the book as a proofreader, gradually became its co-author."
msgstr ""

msgid "While we were obviously satisfied with the book's success, we always hoped that Eyrolles would convince an international editor to translate it into English. We had received numerous comments explaining how the book helped people to get started with Debian, and we were keen to have the book benefit more people in the same way."
msgstr ""

msgid "Alas, no English-speaking editor that we contacted was willing to take the risk of translating and publishing the book. Not put off by this small setback, we negotiated with our French editor Eyrolles and got back the necessary rights to translate the book into English and publish it ourselves. Thanks to a successful crowdfunding campaign, we worked on the translation between December 2011 and May 2012. The “Debian Administrator's Handbook” was born and it was published under a free-software license!"
msgstr ""

msgid "While this was an important milestone, we already knew that the story would be not be over for us until we could contribute the French book as an official translation of the English book. This was not possible at that time because the French book was still distributed commercially under a non-free license by Eyrolles."
msgstr ""

msgid "In 2013, the release of Debian 7 gave us a good opportunity to discuss a new contract with Eyrolles. We convinced them that a license more in line with the Debian values would contribute to the book's success. That wasn't an easy deal to make, and we agreed to setup another crowdfunding campaign to cover some of the costs and reduce the risks involved. The operation was again a huge success and in July 2013, we added a French translation to the Debian Administrator's Handbook."

msgid "The Birth of the English Book"
msgstr ""

msgid "We are back in 2011 and we just got the required rights to make an English translation of our French book. We are looking into ways to make this happen."
msgstr ""

msgid "Translating a book of 450 pages is a considerable effort that requires several months of work. Self-employed people like us had to ensure a minimum income to mobilize the time necessary to complete the project. So we set up a crowdfunding campaign on Ulule and asked people to pledge money towards the project. <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"http://www.ulule.com/debian-handbook/\" />"
msgstr ""

msgid "The campaign had two goals: raising €15,000 for the translation and completing a €25,000 liberation fund to get the resulting book published under a free license — that is, a license that fully follows the Debian Free Software Guidelines."
msgstr ""

msgid "When the Ulule campaign ended, the first goal had been achieved with €24,345 raised. The liberation fund was not complete however, with only €14,935 raised. As initially announced, the liberation campaign continued independently from Ulule on the book's official website."
msgstr ""

msgid "While we were busy translating the book, donations towards the liberation continued to flow in… And in April 2012, the liberation fund was completed. You can thus benefit from this book under the terms of a free license."

From organizing the funding campaign to the last details of the book layout, producing a translated book is so much more than just translating and proofreading, and Raphaël did (or delegated and supervised) it all. So thanks."

msgid "Thanks also to all who more or less directly contributed to this book, by providing clarifications or explanations, or translating advice. They are too many to mention, but most of them can usually be found on various #debian-* IRC channels."

msgid "There is of course some overlap with the previous set of people, but specific thanks are still in order for the people who actually do Debian. There wouldn't be much of a book without them, and I am still amazed at what the Debian project as a whole produces and makes available to any and all."

msgid "More personal thanks go to my friends and my clients, for their understanding when I was less responsive because I was working on this book, and also for their constant support, encouragement and egging on. You know who you are; thanks."

msgid "And finally; I am sure they would be surprised by being mentioned here, but I would like to extend my gratitude to Terry Pratchett, Jasper Fforde, Tom Holt, William Gibson, Neal Stephenson, and of course the late Douglas Adams. The countless hours I spent enjoying their books are directly responsible for my being able to take part in translating one first and writing new parts later."
