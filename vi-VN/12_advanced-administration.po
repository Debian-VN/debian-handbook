msgid "This chapter revisits some aspects we already described, with a different perspective: instead of installing one single computer, we will study mass-deployment systems; instead of creating RAID or LVM volumes at install time, we'll learn to do it by hand so we can later revise our initial choices. Finally, we will discuss monitoring tools and virtualization techniques. As a consequence, this chapter is more particularly targeting professional administrators, and focuses somewhat less on individuals responsible for their home network."

msgid "RAID and LVM"
msgstr ""

msgid "<xref linkend=\"installation\" /> presented these technologies from the point of view of the installer, and how it integrated them to make their deployment easy from the start. After the initial installation, an administrator must be able to handle evolving storage space needs without having to resort to an expensive reinstallation. They must therefore understand the required tools for manipulating RAID and LVM volumes."
msgstr ""

msgid "RAID and LVM are both techniques to abstract the mounted volumes from their physical counterparts (actual hard-disk drives or partitions thereof); the former secures the data against hardware failure by introducing redundancy, the latter makes volume management more flexible and independent of the actual size of the underlying disks. In both cases, the system ends up with new block devices, which can be used to create filesystems or swap space, without necessarily having them mapped to one physical disk. RAID and LVM come from quite different backgrounds, but their functionality can overlap somewhat, which is why they are often mentioned together."
msgstr ""

msgid "<emphasis>PERSPECTIVE</emphasis> Btrfs combines LVM and RAID"
msgstr ""

msgid "While LVM and RAID are two distinct kernel subsystems that come between the disk block devices and their filesystems, <emphasis>btrfs</emphasis> is a new filesystem, initially developed at Oracle, that purports to combine the featuresets of LVM and RAID and much more. It is mostly functional, and although it is still tagged “experimental” because its development is incomplete (some features aren't implemented yet), it has already seen some use in production environments. <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"http://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/\" />"
msgstr ""

msgid "Among the noteworthy features are the ability to take a snapshot of a filesystem tree at any point in time. This snapshot copy doesn't initially use any disk space, the data only being duplicated when one of the copies is modified. The filesystem also handles transparent compression of files, and checksums ensure the integrity of all stored data."
msgstr ""

msgid "In both the RAID and LVM cases, the kernel provides a block device file, similar to the ones corresponding to a hard disk drive or a partition. When an application, or another part of the kernel, requires access to a block of such a device, the appropriate subsystem routes the block to the relevant physical layer. Depending on the configuration, this block can be stored on one or several physical disks, and its physical location may not be directly correlated to the location of the block in the logical device."
msgstr ""

msgid "Software RAID"
msgstr ""

msgid "<primary>RAID</primary>"
msgstr ""

msgid "RAID means <emphasis>Redundant Array of Independent Disks</emphasis>. The goal of this system is to prevent data loss in case of hard disk failure. The general principle is quite simple: data are stored on several physical disks instead of only one, with a configurable level of redundancy. Depending on this amount of redundancy, and even in the event of an unexpected disk failure, data can be losslessly reconstructed from the remaining disks."
msgstr ""

msgid "<emphasis>CULTURE</emphasis> <foreignphrase>Independent</foreignphrase> or <foreignphrase>inexpensive</foreignphrase>?"
msgstr ""

msgid "The I in RAID initially stood for <emphasis>inexpensive</emphasis>, because RAID allowed a drastic increase in data safety without requiring investing in expensive high-end disks. Probably due to image concerns, however, it is now more customarily considered to stand for <emphasis>independent</emphasis>, which doesn't have the unsavory flavour of cheapness."
msgstr ""

msgid "RAID can be implemented either by dedicated hardware (RAID modules integrated into SCSI or SATA controller cards) or by software abstraction (the kernel). Whether hardware or software, a RAID system with enough redundancy can transparently stay operational when a disk fails; the upper layers of the stack (applications) can even keep accessing the data in spite of the failure. Of course, this “degraded mode” can have an impact on performance, and redundancy is reduced, so a further disk failure can lead to data loss. In practice, therefore, one will strive to only stay in this degraded mode for as long as it takes to replace the failed disk. Once the new disk is in place, the RAID system can reconstruct the required data so as to return to a safe mode. The applications won't notice anything, apart from potentially reduced access speed, while the array is in degraded mode or during the reconstruction phase."
msgstr ""

msgid "When RAID is implemented by hardware, its configuration generally happens within the BIOS setup tool, and the kernel will consider a RAID array as a single disk, which will work as a standard physical disk, although the device name may be different (depending on the driver)."
msgstr ""

msgid "We only focus on software RAID in this book."
msgstr ""

msgid "Different RAID Levels"
msgstr ""

msgid "RAID is actually not a single system, but a range of systems identified by their levels; the levels differ by their layout and the amount of redundancy they provide. The more redundant, the more failure-proof, since the system will be able to keep working with more failed disks. The counterpart is that the usable space shrinks for a given set of disks; seen the other way, more disks will be needed to store a given amount of data."
msgstr ""

msgid "Linear RAID"
msgstr ""

msgid "Even though the kernel's RAID subsystem allows creating “linear RAID”, this is not proper RAID, since this setup doesn't involve any redundancy. The kernel merely aggregates several disks end-to-end and provides the resulting aggregated volume as one virtual disk (one block device). That's about its only function. This setup is rarely used by itself (see later for the exceptions), especially since the lack of redundancy means that one disk failing makes the whole aggregate, and therefore all the data, unavailable."
msgstr ""

msgid "RAID-0"
msgstr ""

msgid "This level doesn't provide any redundancy either, but disks aren't simply stuck on end one after another: they are divided in <emphasis>stripes</emphasis>, and the blocks on the virtual device are stored on stripes on alternating physical disks. In a two-disk RAID-0 setup, for instance, even-numbered blocks of the virtual device will be stored on the first physical disk, while odd-numbered blocks will end up on the second physical disk."
msgstr ""

msgid "This system doesn't aim at increasing reliability, since (as in the linear case) the availability of all the data is jeopardized as soon as one disk fails, but at increasing performance: during sequential access to large amounts of contiguous data, the kernel will be able to read from both disks (or write to them) in parallel, which increases the data transfer rate. However, RAID-0 use is shrinking, its niche being filled by LVM (see later)."
msgstr ""

msgid "RAID-1"
msgstr ""

msgid "This level, also known as “RAID mirroring”, is both the simplest and the most widely used setup. In its standard form, it uses two physical disks of the same size, and provides a logical volume of the same size again. Data are stored identically on both disks, hence the “mirror” nickname. When one disk fails, the data is still available on the other. For really critical data, RAID-1 can of course be set up on more than two disks, with a direct impact on the ratio of hardware cost versus available payload space."
msgstr ""

msgid "<emphasis>NOTE</emphasis> Disks and cluster sizes"
msgstr ""

msgid "If two disks of different sizes are set up in a mirror, the bigger one will not be fully used, since it will contain the same data as the smallest one and nothing more. The useful available space provided by a RAID-1 volume therefore matches the size of the smallest disk in the array. This still holds for RAID volumes with a higher RAID level, even though redundancy is stored differently."
msgstr ""

msgid "It is therefore important, when setting up RAID arrays (except for RAID-0 and “linear RAID”), to only assemble disks of identical, or very close, sizes, to avoid wasting resources."
msgstr ""

msgid "<emphasis>NOTE</emphasis> Spare disks"
msgstr ""

msgid "RAID levels that include redundancy allow assigning more disks than required to an array. The extra disks are used as spares when one of the main disks fails. For instance, in a mirror of two disks plus one spare, if one of the first two disks fails, the kernel will automatically (and immediately) reconstruct the mirror using the spare disk, so that redundancy stays assured after the reconstruction time. This can be used as another kind of safeguard for critical data."
msgstr ""

msgid "One would be forgiven for wondering how this is better than simply mirroring on three disks to start with. The advantage of the “spare disk” configuration is that the spare disk can be shared across several RAID volumes. For instance, one can have three mirrored volumes, with redundancy assured even in the event of one disk failure, with only seven disks (three pairs, plus one shared spare), instead of the nine disks that would be required by three triplets."
msgstr ""

msgid "This RAID level, although expensive (since only half of the physical storage space, at best, is useful), is widely used in practice. It is simple to understand, and it allows very simple backups: since both disks have identical contents, one of them can be temporarily extracted with no impact on the working system. Read performance is often increased since the kernel can read half of the data on each disk in parallel, while write performance isn't too severely degraded. In case of a RAID-1 array of N disks, the data stays available even with N-1 disk failures."
msgstr ""

msgid "RAID-4"
msgstr ""

msgid "This RAID level, not widely used, uses N disks to store useful data, and an extra disk to store redundancy information. If that disk fails, the system can reconstruct its contents from the other N. If one of the N data disks fails, the remaining N-1 combined with the “parity” disk contain enough information to reconstruct the required data."
msgstr ""

msgid "RAID-4 isn't too expensive since it only involves a one-in-N increase in costs and has no noticeable impact on read performance, but writes are slowed down. Furthermore, since a write to any of the N disks also involves a write to the parity disk, the latter sees many more writes than the former, and its lifespan can shorten dramatically as a consequence. Data on a RAID-4 array is safe only up to one failed disk (of the N+1)."
msgstr ""

msgid "RAID-5"
msgstr ""

msgid "RAID-5 addresses the asymmetry issue of RAID-4: parity blocks are spread over all of the N+1 disks, with no single disk having a particular role."
msgstr ""

msgid "Read and write performance are identical to RAID-4. Here again, the system stays functional with up to one failed disk (of the N+1), but no more."
msgstr ""

msgid "RAID-6"
msgstr ""

msgid "RAID-6 can be considered an extension of RAID-5, where each series of N blocks involves two redundancy blocks, and each such series of N+2 blocks is spread over N+2 disks."
msgstr ""

msgid "This RAID level is slightly more expensive than the previous two, but it brings some extra safety since up to two drives (of the N+2) can fail without compromising data availability. The counterpart is that write operations now involve writing one data block and two redundancy blocks, which makes them even slower."
msgstr ""

msgid "RAID-1+0"
msgstr ""

msgid "This isn't strictly speaking, a RAID level, but a stacking of two RAID groupings. Starting from 2×N disks, one first sets them up by pairs into N RAID-1 volumes; these N volumes are then aggregated into one, either by “linear RAID” or (increasingly) by LVM. This last case goes farther than pure RAID, but there's no problem with that."
msgstr ""

msgid "RAID-1+0 can survive multiple disk failures: up to N in the 2×N array described above, provided that at least one disk keeps working in each of the RAID-1 pairs."
msgstr ""

msgid "<emphasis>GOING FURTHER</emphasis> RAID-10"
msgstr ""

msgid "RAID-10 is generally considered a synonym of RAID-1+0, but a Linux specificity makes it actually a generalization. This setup allows a system where each block is stored on two different disks, even with an odd number of disks, the copies being spread out along a configurable model."
msgstr ""

msgid "Performances will vary depending on the chosen repartition model and redundancy level, and of the workload of the logical volume."
msgstr ""

msgid "Obviously, the RAID level will be chosen according to the constraints and requirements of each application. Note that a single computer can have several distinct RAID arrays with different configurations."
msgstr ""

msgid "Setting up RAID"
msgstr ""

msgid "<primary><emphasis role=\"pkg\">mdadm</emphasis></primary>"

msgid "Setting up RAID volumes requires the <emphasis role=\"pkg\">mdadm</emphasis> package; it provides the <command>mdadm</command> command, which allows creating and manipulating RAID arrays, as well as scripts and tools integrating it to the rest of the system, including the monitoring system."
msgstr ""

msgid "Our example will be a server with a number of disks, some of which are already used, the rest being available to setup RAID. We initially have the following disks and partitions:"

msgstr ""

msgid "More importantly, note the state of the mirror. The normal state of a RAID mirror is that both disks have exactly the same contents. However, nothing guarantees this is the case when the volume is first created. The RAID subsystem will therefore provide that guarantee itself, and there will be a synchronization phase as soon as the RAID device is created. After some time (the exact amount will depend on the actual size of the disks…), the RAID array switches to the “active” or “clean” state. Note that during this reconstruction phase, the mirror is in a degraded mode, and redundancy isn't assured. A disk failing during that risk window could lead to losing all the data. Large amounts of critical data, however, are rarely stored on a freshly created RAID array before its initial synchronization. Note that even in degraded mode, the <filename>/dev/md1</filename> is usable, and a filesystem can be created on it, as well as some data copied on it."

In such circumstances, it is possible to deliberately create a degraded RAID-1 array by passing <filename>missing</filename> instead of a device file as one of the arguments to <command>mdadm</command>. Once the data have been copied to the “mirror”, the old disk can be added to the array. A synchronization will then take place, giving us the redundancy that was wanted in the first place."

msgid "Backing up the Configuration"
msgstr ""

msgid "Most of the meta-data concerning RAID volumes are saved directly on the disks that make up these arrays, so that the kernel can detect the arrays and their components and assemble them automatically when the system starts up. However, backing up this configuration is encouraged, because this detection isn't fail-proof, and it is only expected that it will fail precisely in sensitive circumstances. In our example, if the <filename>sde</filename> disk failure had been real (instead of simulated) and the system had been restarted without removing this <filename>sde</filename> disk, this disk could start working again due to having been probed during the reboot. The kernel would then have three physical elements, each claiming to contain half of the same RAID volume. Another source of confusion can come when RAID volumes from two servers are consolidated onto one server only. If these arrays were running normally before the disks were moved, the kernel would be able to detect and reassemble the pairs properly; but if the moved disks had been aggregated into an <filename>md1</filename> on the old server, and the new server already has an <filename>md1</filename>, one of the mirrors would be renamed."

msgstr ""

msgid "LVM, the <emphasis>Logical Volume Manager</emphasis>, is another approach to abstracting logical volumes from their physical supports, which focuses on increasing flexibility rather than increasing reliability. LVM allows changing a logical volume transparently as far as the applications are concerned; for instance, it is possible to add new disks, migrate the data to them, and remove the old disks, without unmounting the volume."
msgstr ""

msgid "LVM Concepts"
msgstr ""

msgid "This flexibility is attained by a level of abstraction involving three concepts."
msgstr ""

msgid "First, the PV (<emphasis>Physical Volume</emphasis>) is the entity closest to the hardware: it can be partitions on a disk, or a full disk, or even any other block device (including, for instance, a RAID array). Note that when a physical element is set up to be a PV for LVM, it should only be accessed via LVM, otherwise the system will get confused."
msgstr ""

msgid "A number of PVs can be clustered in a VG (<emphasis>Volume Group</emphasis>), which can be compared to disks both virtual and extensible. VGs are abstract, and don't appear in a device file in the <filename>/dev</filename> hierarchy, so there's no risk of using them directly."
msgstr ""

msgid "The third kind of object is the LV (<emphasis>Logical Volume</emphasis>), which is a chunk of a VG; if we keep the VG-as-disk analogy, the LV compares to a partition. The LV appears as a block device with an entry in <filename>/dev</filename>, and it can be used as any other physical partition can be (most commonly, to host a filesystem or swap space)."
msgstr ""

msgid "The important thing is that the splitting of a VG into LVs is entirely independent of its physical components (the PVs). A VG with only a single physical component (a disk for instance) can be split into a dozen logical volumes; similarly, a VG can use several physical disks and appear as a single large logical volume. The only constraint, obviously, is that the total size allocated to LVs can't be bigger than the total capacity of the PVs in the volume group."
msgstr ""

msgid "It often makes sense, however, to have some kind of homogeneity among the physical components of a VG, and to split the VG into logical volumes that will have similar usage patterns. For instance, if the available hardware includes fast disks and slower disks, the fast ones could be clustered into one VG and the slower ones into another; chunks of the first one can then be assigned to applications requiring fast data access, while the second one will be kept for less demanding tasks."
msgstr ""

msgid "In any case, keep in mind that an LV isn't particularly attached to any one PV. It is possible to influence where the data from an LV are physically stored, but this possibility isn't required for day-to-day use. On the contrary: when the set of physical components of a VG evolves, the physical storage locations corresponding to a particular LV can be migrated across disks (while staying within the PVs assigned to the VG, of course)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Setting up LVM"
msgstr ""

msgid "Let us now follow, step by step, the process of setting up LVM for a typical use case: we want to simplify a complex storage situation. Such a situation usually happens after some long and convoluted history of accumulated temporary measures. For the purposes of illustration, we'll consider a server where the storage needs have changed over time, ending up in a maze of available partitions split over several partially used disks. In more concrete terms, the following partitions are available:"
msgstr ""

msgid "on the <filename>sdb</filename> disk, a <filename>sdb2</filename> partition, 4 GB;"

msgid "on the <filename>sdc</filename> disk, a <filename>sdc3</filename> partition, 3 GB;"

msgstr ""

msgid "on the <filename>sdf</filename> disk, a <filename>sdf1</filename> partition, 4 GB; and a <filename>sdf2</filename> partition, 5 GB."
msgstr ""

msgid "In addition, let's assume that disks <filename>sdb</filename> and <filename>sdf</filename> are faster than the other two."
msgstr ""

msgid "Our goal is to set up three logical volumes for three different applications: a file server requiring 5 GB of storage space, a database (1 GB) and some space for back-ups (12 GB). The first two need good performance, but back-ups are less critical in terms of access speed. All these constraints prevent the use of partitions on their own; using LVM can abstract the physical size of the devices, so the only limit is the total available space."
msgstr ""

msgid "The required tools are in the <emphasis role=\"pkg\">lvm2</emphasis> package and its dependencies. When they're installed, setting up LVM takes three steps, matching the three levels of concepts."

msgid "RAID or LVM?"
msgstr ""

msgid "RAID and LVM both bring indisputable advantages as soon as one leaves the simple case of a desktop computer with a single hard disk where the usage pattern doesn't change over time. However, RAID and LVM go in two different directions, with diverging goals, and it is legitimate to wonder which one should be adopted. The most appropriate answer will of course depend on current and foreseeable requirements."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are a few simple cases where the question doesn't really arise. If the requirement is to safeguard data against hardware failures, then obviously RAID will be set up on a redundant array of disks, since LVM doesn't really address this problem. If, on the other hand, the need is for a flexible storage scheme where the volumes are made independent of the physical layout of the disks, RAID doesn't help much and LVM will be the natural choice."
msgstr ""

msgid "<emphasis>NOTE</emphasis> If performance matters…"
msgstr ""

msgid "If input/output speed is of the essence, especially in terms of access times, using LVM and/or RAID in one of the many combinations may have some impact on performances, and this may influence decisions as to which to pick. However, these differences in performance are really minor, and will only be measurable in a few use cases. If performance matters, the best gain to be obtained would be to use non-rotating storage media (<indexterm><primary>SSD</primary></indexterm><emphasis>solid-state drives</emphasis> or SSDs); their cost per megabyte is higher than that of standard hard disk drives, and their capacity is usually smaller, but they provide excellent performance for random accesses. If the usage pattern includes many input/output operations scattered all around the filesystem, for instance for databases where complex queries are routinely being run, then the advantage of running them on an SSD far outweigh whatever could be gained by picking LVM over RAID or the reverse. In these situations, the choice should be determined by other considerations than pure speed, since the performance aspect is most easily handled by using SSDs."
msgstr ""

msgid "The third notable use case is when one just wants to aggregate two disks into one volume, either for performance reasons or to have a single filesystem that is larger than any of the available disks. This case can be addressed both by a RAID-0 (or even linear-RAID) and by an LVM volume. When in this situation, and barring extra constraints (for instance, keeping in line with the rest of the computers if they only use RAID), the configuration of choice will often be LVM. The initial set up is barely more complex, and that slight increase in complexity more than makes up for the extra flexibility that LVM brings if the requirements change or if new disks need to be added."
msgstr ""

msgid "Then of course, there is the really interesting use case, where the storage system needs to be made both resistant to hardware failure and flexible when it comes to volume allocation. Neither RAID nor LVM can address both requirements on their own; no matter, this is where we use both at the same time — or rather, one on top of the other. The scheme that has all but become a standard since RAID and LVM have reached maturity is to ensure data redundancy first by grouping disks in a small number of large RAID arrays, and to use these RAID arrays as LVM physical volumes; logical partitions will then be carved from these LVs for filesystems. The selling point of this setup is that when a disk fails, only a small number of RAID arrays will need to be reconstructed, thereby limiting the time spent by the administrator for recovery."
msgstr ""

msgid "Let's take a concrete example: the public relations department at Falcot Corp needs a workstation for video editing, but the department's budget doesn't allow investing in high-end hardware from the bottom up. A decision is made to favor the hardware that is specific to the graphic nature of the work (monitor and video card), and to stay with generic hardware for storage. However, as is widely known, digital video does have some particular requirements for its storage: the amount of data to store is large, and the throughput rate for reading and writing this data is important for the overall system performance (more than typical access time, for instance). These constraints need to be fulfilled with generic hardware, in this case two 300 GB SATA hard disk drives; the system data must also be made resistant to hardware failure, as well as some of the user data. Edited videoclips must indeed be safe, but video rushes pending editing are less critical, since they're still on the videotapes."

msgid "The rationale for the second split (<filename>md1</filename> vs. <filename>md2</filename>) is less clear-cut, and more related to acknowledging that the future is uncertain. When the workstation is first assembled, the exact storage requirements are not necessarily known with perfect precision; they can also evolve over time. In our case, we can't know in advance the actual storage space requirements for video rushes and complete video clips. If one particular clip needs a very large amount of rushes, and the VG dedicated to redundant data is less than halfway full, we can re-use some of its unneeded space. We can remove one of the physical volumes, say <filename>md2</filename>, from <filename>vg_raid</filename> and either assign it to <filename>vg_bulk</filename> directly (if the expected duration of the operation is short enough that we can live with the temporary drop in performance), or undo the RAID setup on <filename>md2</filename> and integrate its components <filename>sda6</filename> and <filename>sdc6</filename> into the bulk VG (which grows by 200 GB instead of 100 GB); the <filename>lv_rushes</filename> logical volume can then be grown according to requirements."

However, it would be quite inconvenient to add a network card for each domU; which is why Xen allows creating virtual interfaces, that each domain can see and use in a standard way.

msgid "Even though it is used to build “virtual machines”, LXC is not, strictly speaking, a virtualization system, but a system to isolate groups of processes from each other even though they all run on the same host. It takes advantage of a set of recent evolutions in the Linux kernel, collectively known as <emphasis>control groups</emphasis>, by which different sets of processes called “groups” have different views of certain aspects of the overall system. Most notable among these aspects are the process identifiers, the network configuration, and the mount points. Such a group of isolated processes will not have any access to the other processes in the system, and its accesses to the filesystem can be restricted to a specific subset. It can also have its own network interface and routing table, and it may be configured to only see a subset of the available devices present on the system."
msgstr ""

msgid "These features can be combined to isolate a whole process family starting from the <command>init</command> process, and the resulting set looks very much like a virtual machine. The official name for such a setup is a “container” (hence the LXC moniker: <emphasis>LinuX Containers</emphasis>), but a rather important difference with “real” virtual machines such as provided by Xen or KVM is that there's no second kernel; the container uses the very same kernel as the host system. This has both pros and cons: advantages include excellent performance due to the total lack of overhead, and the fact that the kernel has a global vision of all the processes running on the system, so the scheduling can be more efficient than it would be if two independent kernels were to schedule different task sets. Chief among the inconveniences is the impossibility to run a different kernel in a container (whether a different Linux version or a different operating system altogether)."

msgid "LXC containers do not provide the level of isolation achieved by heavier emulators or virtualizers. In particular:"

msgstr ""

msgid "on the filesystem, the kernel checks permissions according to the numerical identifiers for users and groups; these identifiers may designate different users and groups depending on the container, which should be kept in mind if writable parts of the filesystem are shared among containers."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "Preliminary Steps"
msgstr ""

msgid "The <emphasis role=\"pkg\">lxc</emphasis> package contains the tools required to run LXC, and must therefore be installed."
msgstr ""

msgid "LXC also requires the <emphasis>control groups</emphasis> configuration system, which is a virtual filesystem to be mounted on <filename>/sys/fs/cgroup</filename>. Since Debian 8 switched to systemd, which also relies on control groups, this is now done automatically at boot time without further configuration."
msgstr ""

msgid "Network Configuration"
msgstr ""

msgid "The goal of installing LXC is to set up virtual machines; while we could of course keep them isolated from the network, and only communicate with them via the filesystem, most use cases involve giving at least minimal network access to the containers. In the typical case, each container will get a virtual network interface, connected to the real network through a bridge. This virtual interface can be plugged either directly onto the host's physical network interface (in which case the container is directly on the network), or onto another virtual interface defined on the host (and the host can then filter or route traffic). In both cases, the <emphasis role=\"pkg\">bridge-utils</emphasis> package will be required."
msgstr ""

msgid "The simple case is just a matter of editing <filename>/etc/network/interfaces</filename>, moving the configuration for the physical interface (for instance <literal>eth0</literal>) to a bridge interface (usually <literal>br0</literal>), and configuring the link between them. For instance, if the network interface configuration file initially contains entries such as the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid "auto eth0\n"
"iface eth0 inet dhcp"
msgstr ""

msgid "They should be disabled and replaced with the following:"
msgstr ""

"#auto eth0\n"
"#iface eth0 inet dhcp\n"
"\n"
"auto br0\n"
"iface br0 inet dhcp\n"
"  bridge-ports eth0"
msgstr ""

msgid "The effect of this configuration will be similar to what would be obtained if the containers were machines plugged into the same physical network as the host. The “bridge” configuration manages the transit of Ethernet frames between all the bridged interfaces, which includes the physical <literal>eth0</literal> as well as the interfaces defined for the containers."
msgstr ""

msgid "In cases where this configuration cannot be used (for instance if no public IP addresses can be assigned to the containers), a virtual <emphasis>tap</emphasis> interface will be created and connected to the bridge. The equivalent network topology then becomes that of a host with a second network card plugged into a separate switch, with the containers also plugged into that switch. The host must then act as a gateway for the containers if they are meant to communicate with the outside world."
msgstr ""

msgid "In addition to <emphasis role=\"pkg\">bridge-utils</emphasis>, this “rich” configuration requires the <emphasis role=\"pkg\">vde2</emphasis> package; the <filename>/etc/network/interfaces</filename> file then becomes:"

Similarly, security updates must not be automated, because they have to go through the centralized reference image maintained by SystemImager. This solution also requires the target machines to be homogeneous, otherwise many different images would have to be kept and managed (an i386 image won't fit on a powerpc machine, and so on)."

However, the standard installer will only install standard Debian versions, with the base system and a set of pre-selected “tasks”; this precludes installing a particular system with non-packaged applications. Fulfilling this particular need requires customizing the installer… Fortunately, the installer is very modular, and there are tools to automate most of the work required for this customization, most importantly simple-CDD (CDD being an acronym for <emphasis>Custom Debian Derivative</emphasis>).
