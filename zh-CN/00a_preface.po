msgid "Preface"
msgstr "序"

msgid "Debian is a very successful operating system, which is pervasive in our digital lives more than people often imagine or are aware of. A few data points will suffice to make this clear. At the time of writing Debian is the most popular GNU/Linux variant among web servers: according to <ulink url=\"http://w3techs.com/\">W3Techs</ulink>, more than 10% of the web is Debian-powered. Think about it: how many web sites would have you missed today without Debian? Onto more fascinating deployments, Debian is the operating system of choice on the International Space Station. Have you been following the work of ISS astronauts, maybe via the social network presence of NASA or other international organizations? Both the work in itself and the posts about it have been made possible by Debian. Countless companies, universities, and public administrations rely on Debian daily for their operations, delivering services to millions of users around the world... and its orbit!"
msgstr "Debian 作为一款非常成功的操作系统，在不经意间已经渗透到我们数字生活的方方面面。一组数据可以充分证明这一点，Debian 是当时 Web 服务器端最流行的 GNU/Linux 发行版： 根据 <ulink url=\"http://w3techs.com/\">W3Techs</ulink> 的数据，有超过10%的网页背后运行着 Debian 。试想一下：今年你错过了多少网页没有 Debian 参与？再来说个更有趣的，Debian 被部署在了国际空间站上。你曾经是否关注过国际空间站的宇航员，也许是通过 NASA 的社交网络亦或是其他国际组织？这些正是因为有了 Debian 才成为可能。无数的公司、高校，以及其他公共管理机构每天与 Debian 打交道，将这些服务传递给全球数以万计的用户……以及地球轨道上的国际空间站！"

msgid "But Debian is much more than an operating system, no matter how complex, featureful, and reliable such a system could be. Debian is a vision of the freedoms that people should enjoy in a world where more and more of our daily activities depend on software. Debian is born from the cardinal Free Software idea that people should be in control of their computers, and not the other way around. People with enough software knowledge should be able to dismantle, modify, reassemble and share with others all the software that matters to them. It doesn't matter if the software is used for frivolous activities like posting pictures of kittens on the Web, or for potentially life-threatening tasks such as driving our cars and powering the medical devices which cure us — and Debian is used in all of the above scenarios; you should control it. People without in-depth software knowledge should enjoy those freedoms too: they should be able to delegate to people of their choice, people they trust, the audit or modification of software-based devices on their behalf."
msgstr "尽管作为一个操作系统，Debian 复杂完善，可靠，有各种性能及特点，但 Debian 又不仅仅是一个操作系统。Debian 又是一个自由的王国，在这个王国中，人们应当享受依赖软件来完成日益复杂的日常任务的生活。关于自由的软件的理念认为，用户应该能直接的控制他们的电脑，而不是通过其他迂回的方式。而 Debian 就诞生于这种理念。拥有足够电脑知识的用户应该能够拆分，修改，重组他们感兴趣的软件，并同他人共享。只要用户能够直接的控制电脑，控制软件，那么无论这些软件是在做在网上发布小猫的图片这些日常琐事，还是替我们驾驶汽车，或是完成驱动医疗设备这样性命攸关的大事，就显得不再那么重要了。而那些相对不了解电脑知识的人也应能享受到 Debian 的自由：这些人将能够对他们所信任的，拥有审计和修改软件能力的人授权，被他们代表。"

msgid "In the quest for the control of people over machines, Free operating systems play a fundamental role: you cannot be in full control of a computer device if you do not control its operating system. This is where Debian's main ambition comes from: producing the best, entirely Free operating system. For more than 20 years now, Debian has both developed a Free operating system and promoted a vision of Free Software around it. In so doing, Debian has set a very high bar for software freedom advocates around the world. Debian's decisions on matters of software licensing, for example, are routinely looked to by international standard organizations, governments, and other Free Software projects, when deciding if something should be considered “free enough” or not."
msgstr "在人们控制机器的问题上，自由免费的操作系统中发挥着基础性作用：如果你不能控制计算机的操作系统，你就不能完全控制计算机设备。这是 Debian 的主要愿景来源：开发最好的，完全自由免费的操作系统。20多年来，Debian 既开发了一个自由免费的操作系统，同时也推动了其周边发展自由软件的愿景。如此，Debian 为世界各地的自由软件倡导者树立了很高的标杆。当考虑某件事情是否应该被认为“足够自由“的时候，Debian 所作的决定，例如软件许可事项，常常会被国际标准组织、政府和其他自由软件项目作为参考。"

msgid "But this political vision is not yet enough to explain Debian's uniqueness. Debian is also a very peculiar social experiment, strongly attached to its independence. Think for a moment of other mainstream Free Software distributions, or even of popular <emphasis>proprietary</emphasis> operating systems. Chances are that you can associate each of them with a large company that is either the main development force behind the project, or at the very least the steward of all its non-development activities. Debian is different. Within the Debian Project volunteers pack on themselves the responsibilities of all the activities that are needed to keep Debian alive and kicking. The variety of those activities is stunning: from translations to system administration, from marketing to management, from conference organization to artwork design, from bookkeeping to legal issues... not to mention software packaging and development! Debian contributors take care of all of these."
msgstr "但是这样的政治愿景仍不足以解释 Debian 的独特之处。Debian 也是一个非常独特的社会实验，这与其独立性紧密相关。请试着考虑一下其它主流的基于自由软件的发行版，或者甚至是流行的<emphasis>专有</emphasis>操作系统。您很可能发现它们每一个都和一个大型企业有所关联：这些企业或是其项目背后的主要开发力量，或至少是其所有非开发活动的组织者。Debian 则不一样。在 Debian 项目中， 志愿者自己担负起责任，组织所有让 Debian 项目存活并发展所必需的活动。这些活动五花八门，足以让人头昏脑胀：从翻译到系统管理，从市场营销到项目管理，从会议组织到艺术设计，从账务记录到法律事务……更不要提还有最基础的软件打包和开发呢！然而，Debian 贡献者们肩负起了这些所有的事情。"

msgid "As a first consequence of this radical form of independence, Debian needs and relies on a very diverse community of volunteers. Any skill in any of the above areas, or others you can imagine, can be invested into Debian and will be used to improve the project. A second consequence of Debian independence is that Debian's choices can be trusted not to be driven by the commercial interests of specific companies — interests that we have no guarantee will always be aligned with the goal of promoting people's control over machines, as too many recent examples in the tech news testify."
msgstr "作为这种以独立为根本的组织形式的第一个结果，Debian 需要并依赖于具有高度多样性的社区志愿者。任何上述领域的技能，或者其它你可以想象到的方面，都能够应用于 Debian 中并让项目得到改善与提高。Debian 独立性的第二个结果是，Debian 的选择能够被确信是不受特定企业的商业利益所左右的——这些利益并不会永远与我们希望增进人们对机器的控制这一目标保持一致。近期的技术新闻中有太多类似的例子可以证明这一点。"

msgid "One last aspect contributes to Debian's uniqueness: the way in which the social experiment is run. Despite the folklore of being bureaucratic, decision making in Debian is in fact highly distributed. There exist clearly defined areas of responsibility within the project. People in charge of those areas are free to drive their own boat. As long as they keep up with the quality requirements agreed upon by the community, no one can tell them what to do or how to do their job. If you want to have a say on how something is done in Debian, you need to put yourself on the line and be ready to take the job on your shoulders. This peculiar form of meritocracy — which we sometimes call <emphasis>do-ocracy</emphasis> — is very empowering for contributors. Anyone with enough skills, time, and motivation can have a real impact on the direction the project is taking. This is testified by a population of about 1 000 official members of the Debian Project, and several thousands of contributors world-wide. It is no wonder that Debian is often credited as the largest community-driven Free Software project in existence."
msgstr "最后一个成就 Debian 独特之处的因素：这个社会实验运行的方式。尽管有着项目官僚化的传言，但 Debian 内的决策实际上仍然是高度分散的。项目中存在着清晰确定的责任范围，负责各自区域的人们可以在范围中自由发挥。只要他们达到了社区广泛认可的质量要求，没有哪个人可以去要求他们究竟该做什么，或者应该如何做他们自己的工作。如果你想要对 Debian 中的某些工作指手画脚，你可能需要自己站上起跑线，做好亲自接管这些工作的准备。这个奇特的精英阶级的形式——有时候我们称之为<emphasis>行动阶级</emphasis>——十分有利于向做出贡献的人授予权力。任何有足够的技能、时间和动力的人都可以对项目的前进方向产生实在的影响。这已经被大约1000名 Debian 项目的正式成员以及数千名遍布全世界的贡献者们所证实。这也是Debian常常被称为现存最大的社区驱动的自由软件项目的原因。"

msgid "So Debian is quite unique. Are we the only ones noticing this? Definitely not. According to <ulink url=\"http://distrowatch.com/\">DistroWatch</ulink> there are about 300 active Free Software distributions around. Half of that (about 140) are Debian <emphasis>derivatives</emphasis>. That means that they start from Debian, adapt it to fit the needs of their users — usually by adding, modifying, and rebuilding packages — and release the resulting product. In essence, derivatives apply the Free Software granted freedoms of modifying and redistributing copies not only to individual pieces of software, but to a distribution as a whole. The potential of reaching out to new Free Software users and contributors by the means of derivative distributions is huge. We believe that it is mainly thanks to that thriving ecosystem that Free Software is nowadays finally rivaling with proprietary software in fields which were historically considered hard to conquer, such as large desktop deployments. Debian sits at the root of the largest ecosystem of Free Software distributions in existence: even if you are not using Debian directly, and even if your distributor has not told you, chances are that you are benefiting right now from the work of the Debian community."
msgstr "因此，Debian 是颇为独特的。我们是唯一注意到这个事实的人吗？当然不是。根据 <ulink url=\"http://distrowatch.com/\">DistroWatch</ulink>，目前存在约300个活跃的自由软件发行版。其中接近一半（大概有140个）是 Debian <emphasis>派生</emphasis>而来。这意味着它们从 Debian 开始，改写它使其符合它们用户的需求——通常方式是添加、修改和重新构建软件包——然后释出最终的产品。实质上，派生版本不仅应用了自由软件授予的自由修改、再分发独立软件副本的权利，更是将这个权利应用到了整个发行版上。经由派生发行版而接触到新的自由软件用户和开发者的潜力十分巨大。我们相信如此繁荣发展的生态系统正是自由软件今日终于能够和专有软件在那些历史上通常认为是难以撼动的领域，例如大型桌面部署这样的领域，有一决高下的能力的主要因素。Debian 作为当前存在的自由软件发行版中最大的一个生态环境中的的基石：即使你不在直接使用 Debian，甚至即便你的（软件）发行者从没有告诉过你，你也有可能正在享受着 Debian 社区的工作产生的益处。"

msgid "But Debian's uniqueness sometimes comes with unexpected consequences. A consequence of Debian's vision on digital freedoms has been the need of redefining what we mean by <emphasis>software</emphasis>. The Debian Project has since long realized that, as part of an operating system, you need to distribute a lot of non-software material: music, images, documentation, raw data, firmware, etc. But how do you apply <emphasis>software</emphasis> freedoms to that material? Should we have different requirements or should all material be held up to the same high standard of freedom? The Debian Project has decided for the latter: all material shipped as part of Debian should offer the same freedoms to its users. Such a radical philosophical position has far reaching effects. It means we cannot distribute non-free firmware, or artwork not meant to be used in commercial settings, or books that cannot be modified in order to avoid tarnishing (as book publishers folklore goes) the author's/publisher's reputation."
msgstr "但是 Debian 的独特性有时候也会带来不可预料的结果。一个 Debian 对数字自由的愿景所带来的结果便是对我们所谓<emphasis>软件</emphasis>的重新定义。Debian 项目一直以来都意识到，作为操作系统的一部分，你需要发布许多非软件的材料：音乐、图像、文档、原始数据、固件等等。但是究竟该如何将<emphasis>软件</emphasis>自由应用到那些材料上去呢？我们是应该对其持有不同的要求，或者是所有的材料都应该支撑起同样高标准的自由呢？Debian 项目决定采用后者：所有作为 Debian 的一部分而发行的材料应当向用户提供相同程度的自由。这样激进的哲学观点产生了深远的影响。这意味着我们不能够分发不自由的固件，或者那些不被允许在商业环境中使用的艺术作品，或者那些为了避免作者或出版商名誉受损而禁止修改的书籍（参照书籍出版商的所作所为）。"

msgid "The book you have in your hands is different. It's a <emphasis>free as in freedom</emphasis> book, a book which is up to Debian freedom standards for every aspect of your digital life. For a very long time, the scarce availability of books like this one has been a significant shortcoming of Debian. It meant that there was little reading material that helped to spread Debian and its values, while at the same time embodying those values and showing off their advantages. But it also meant, ironically, that we had little such material that we could distribute as part of Debian itself. This is the first reputable book to address this shortcoming. You can <command>apt install</command> this book, you can redistribute it, you can fork this book or, better, submit bug reports and patches for it, so that others in the future can benefit from your contributions. The “maintainers” of this book — who are also its authors — are longstanding members of the Debian Project, who grok the freedom ethos that permeates every aspect of Debian and know first-hand what it means to take on the responsibility for important parts of Debian. By releasing this Free book they are doing, once more, such a wonderful service to the Debian community."
msgstr "你手中的这本书则不一样。它是一本<emphasis>自由中的自由</emphasis>之书，在你的数字生活的各个方面都达到了 Debian 的标准。很长一段时间以来，像本书一样的同类书籍之稀缺一直是 Debian 的一个重要的短板。它意味着缺乏合适的用来散布 Debian 及其价值，同时又能具体化这些价值并展示其优点的阅读材料。但讽刺的是，这同样意味着我们缺少类似的、可以作为 Debian 自身的一部分来发布的类似材料。本书是第一本用来弥补这些缺点的知名书籍。你可以 <command>apt install</command> 这本书，你可以重新分发本书，你可以创建本书的分支，或者更好的是，为它提交漏洞报告和补丁，从而使得其他人也能在未来因此获益。本书的“维护者”——即它的作者——是 Debian 项目的资深成员，他们对渗透于 Debian 方方面面中的自由精神有着深刻的理解，也拥有第一手资料，知晓承担 Debian 重要部分的责任究竟意味着什么。将他们所制作的这本自由之书公布于世，即是再一次的，向 Debian 社区提供的极好服务。"

msgid "We hope you will enjoy this cornerstone of Debian reading Freedom as much as we did."
msgstr "我们希望你能够和我们一起，享受这本 Debian 式的阅读自由之基石。"

#~ msgid "At the same time, many influential actors in the computing industry have now come to understand the strategic interest of using an elaborate distribution that is not managed by a commercial entity. Some of their customers also understand — following the same logic — that a software platform that does not depend on agreements between suppliers reduces the constraints they will have after the purchase."

#~ msgid "Debian — which used to be low-profile — was first adopted by passionate users, who were often attracted by the spirit it embodies. They found a project with clear goals and visible achievements, whose developers focus on creating a good design <emphasis>before</emphasis> building — thereby rejecting the deadlines that often compromise the quality of so many other software projects. Debian is led by its very actors. In other words, Debian users join a project that fully benefits from the advantages of free software… so as to produce free software themselves."
#~ msgstr "原本低调的 Debian 因其自身所具备的精神，吸引了一批狂热的用户。他们发现这个项目具有明确的目标和可见的成果；开发者们在开发<emphasis>之前</emphasis>就致力于创造一个良好的设计，从而避免了陷入许多其他软件项目通常会经历的困境－－软件质量往往被截止时间所影响。 Debian 是由自己所领导的。换句话说，用户加入 Debian 这个项目，既能充分受益于自由软件的优势，又可以自己生产自由软件。"
