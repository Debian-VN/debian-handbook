msgid "Any computer system overhaul should take the existing system into account. This allows reuse of available resources as much as possible and guarantees interoperability of the various elements comprising the system. This study will introduce a generic framework to follow in any migration of a computing infrastructure to Linux."
msgstr "任何系统的彻底修检都应考虑到已有的系统。其中包括让尽可能多的资源复用，和保证组成系统的各个部分协调无碍。以下的学习案列会介绍一个将设备向 Linux 迁移的通用技术框架。"

msgid "Debian integrates very well in all types of existing environments and plays well with any other operating system. This near-perfect harmony comes from market pressure which demands that software publishers develop programs that follow standards. Compliance with standards allows administrators to switch out programs: clients or servers, whether free or not."
msgstr "Debian能和已存的环境整合无碍，并和其他操作系统共存。这近乎完美的和谐来自市场的压力：市场要求软件发布者需要遵从一定的标准。接受这些标准让管理员能灵活替换各种程序，客户端或服务端，免费与否，都不是问题。"

msgid "OS X machines provide, and are able to use, network services such as file servers and printer sharing. These services are published on the local network, which allows other machines to discover them and make use of them without any manual configuration, using the Bonjour implementation of the Zeroconf protocol suite. Debian includes another implementation, called Avahi, which provides the same functionality."

msgid "In the other direction, the Netatalk daemon can be used to provide file servers to OS X machines on the network. It implements the AFP (AppleShare) protocol as well as the required notifications so that the servers can be autodiscovered by the OS X clients."
msgstr ""

msgid "<primary>AppleTalk</primary>"
msgstr ""

msgid "Older Mac OS networks (before OS X) used a different protocol called AppleTalk. For environments involving machines using this protocol, Netatalk also provides the AppleTalk protocol (in fact, it started as a reimplementation of that protocol). It ensures the operation of the file server and print queues, as well as time server (clock synchronization). Its router function allows interconnection with AppleTalk networks."

msgid "Integration with Other Linux/Unix Machines"

msgid "Finally, NFS and NIS, both included, guarantee interaction with Unix systems. NFS ensures file server functionality, while NIS creates user directories. The BSD printing layer, used by most Unix systems, also allows sharing of print queues."

msgstr "<primary>迁移</primary>"

msgid "In order to guarantee continuity of the services, each computer migration must be planned and executed according to the plan. This principle applies whatever the operating system used."

msgid "Survey and Identify Services"
msgstr ""

msgid "As simple as it seems, this step is essential. A serious administrator truly knows the principal roles of each server, but such roles can change, and sometimes experienced users may have installed “wild” services. Knowing that they exist will at least allow you to decide what to do with them, rather than delete them haphazardly."
msgstr ""

msgid "For this purpose, it is wise to inform your users of the project before migrating the server. To involve them in the project, it may be useful to install the most common free software programs on their desktops prior to migration, which they will come across again after the migration to Debian; Libre Office and the Mozilla suite are the best examples here."

msgid "<emphasis>ALTERNATIVE</emphasis> Use <command>netstat</command> to find the list of available services"
msgstr ""

msgid "On a Linux machine, the <command>netstat -tupan</command> command will show the list of active or pending TCP sessions, as well UDP ports on which running programs are listening. This facilitates identification of services offered on the network."
msgstr ""

msgid "<emphasis>GOING FURTHER</emphasis> IPv6"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some network commands may work either with IPv4 (the default usually) or with IPv6. These include the <command>nmap</command> and <command>netstat</command> commands, but also others, such as <command>route</command> or <command>ip</command>. The convention is that this behavior is enabled by the <parameter>-6</parameter> command-line option."
msgstr ""

msgid "If the server is a Unix machine offering shell accounts to users, it is interesting to determine if processes are executed in the background in the absence of their owner. The command <command>ps auxw</command> displays a list of all processes with their user identity. By checking this information against the output of the <command>who</command> command, which gives a list of logged in users, it is possible to identify rogue or undeclared servers or programs running in the background. Looking at <filename>crontabs</filename> (tables listing automatic actions scheduled by users) will often provide interesting information on functions fulfilled by the server (a complete explanation of <command>cron</command> is available in <xref linkend=\"sect.task-scheduling-cron-atd\" />)."
msgstr ""

msgid "In any case, it is essential to backup your servers: this allows recovery of information after the fact, when users will report specific problems due to the migration."
msgstr ""

msgid "Backing up the Configuration"
msgstr ""

msgid "It is wise to retain the configuration of every identified service in order to be able to install the equivalent on the updated server. The bare minimum is to make a backup copy of the configuration files."
msgstr ""

msgid "For Unix machines, the configuration files are usually found in <filename>/etc/</filename>, but they may be located in a sub-directory of <filename>/usr/local/</filename>. This is the case if a program has been installed from sources, rather than with a package. In some cases, one may also find them under <filename>/opt/</filename>."
msgstr ""

msgid "For data managing services (such as databases), it is strongly recommended to export the data to a standard format that will be easily imported by the new software. Such a format is usually in text mode and documented; it may be, for example, an SQL dump for a database, or an LDIF file for an LDAP server."
msgstr ""

msgid "Database backups"
msgstr ""

msgid "Each server software is different, and it is impossible to describe all existing cases in detail. Compare the documentation for the existing and the new software to identify the exportable (thus, re-importable) portions and those which will require manual handling. Reading this book will clarify the configuration of the main Linux server programs."

msgid "To effectively take over its maintenance, one may analyze a machine already running with Debian."
msgstr ""

msgid "The first file to check is <filename>/etc/debian_version</filename>, which usually contains the version number for the installed Debian system (it is part of the <emphasis>base-files</emphasis> package). If it indicates <literal><replaceable>codename</replaceable>/sid</literal>, it means that the system was updated with packages coming from one of the development distributions (either testing or unstable)."
msgstr ""

msgid "The <command>apt-show-versions</command> program (from the Debian package of the same name) checks the list of installed packages and identifies the available versions. <command>aptitude</command> can also be used for these tasks, albeit in a less systematic manner."
msgstr ""

msgid "A glance at the <filename>/etc/apt/sources.list</filename> file (and <filename>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/</filename> directory) will show where the installed Debian packages likely came from. If many unknown sources appear, the administrator may choose to completely reinstall the computer's system to ensure optimal compatibility with the software provided by Debian."
msgstr ""

msgid "The <filename>sources.list</filename> file is often a good indicator: the majority of administrators keep, at least in comments, the list of APT sources that were previously used. But you should not forget that sources used in the past might have been deleted, and that some random packages grabbed on the Internet might have been manually installed (with the <command>dpkg</command> command). In this case, the machine is misleading in its appearance of “standard” Debian. This is why you should pay attention to any indication that will give away the presence of external packages (appearance of <filename>deb</filename> files in unusual directories, package version numbers with a special suffix indicating that it originated from outside the Debian project, such as <literal>ubuntu</literal> or <literal>lmde</literal>, etc.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Likewise, it is interesting to analyze the contents of the <filename>/usr/local/</filename> directory, whose purpose is to contain programs compiled and installed manually. Listing software installed in this manner is instructive, since this raises questions on the reasons for not using the corresponding Debian package, if such a package exists."
msgstr ""

msgid "<emphasis>QUICK LOOK</emphasis> <emphasis role=\"pkg\">cruft</emphasis>"
msgstr ""

msgid "The <emphasis role=\"pkg\">cruft</emphasis> package proposes to list the available files that are not owned by any package. It has some filters (more or less effective, and more or less up to date) to avoid reporting some legitimate files (files generated by Debian packages, or generated configuration files not managed by <command>dpkg</command>, etc.)."

msgid "Most recent computers have 64 bit Intel or AMD processors, compatible with older 32 bit processors; the software compiled for “i386” architecture thus works. On the other hand, this compatibility mode does not fully exploit the capabilities of these new processors. This is why Debian provides the “amd64” architecture, which works for recent AMD chips as well as Intel “em64t” processors (including most of the Core series), which are very similar to AMD64."
