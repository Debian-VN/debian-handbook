msgstr "<emphasis>文化</emphasis> Debian 名称的起源"

msgid "Look no further: Debian is not an acronym. This name is, in reality, a contraction of two first names: that of Ian Murdock, and his girlfriend at the time, Debra. Debra + Ian = Debian."
msgstr "没有什么特别的：Debian 不是一个缩写词。它的名字实际上是两个姓氏的组合：Ian Murdock，和他那时的女朋友，Debra。所以就有了 Debra + Ian = Debian。"

msgid "Debian is a GNU/Linux distribution. We will discuss what a distribution is in further detail in <xref linkend=\"sect.role-of-distributions\" />, but for now, we will simply state that it is a complete operating system, including software and systems for installation and management, all based on the Linux kernel and free software (especially those from the GNU project)."
msgstr "Debian 是一个 GNU/Linux 的发行版。我们稍后将会详细地讨论什么是发行版<xref linkend=\"sect.role-of-distributions\" />。但是当前情况下，我们暂且将其简单地归纳为一个完整的操作系统，包括软件和系统的安装及管理，所有的这些都基于 Linux 内核和自由软件（尤其是来自 GNU 项目的自由软件）。"

msgid "When he created Debian, in 1993, under the leadership of the FSF, Ian Murdock had clear objectives, which he expressed in the <emphasis>Debian Manifesto</emphasis>. The free operating system that he sought would have to have two principal features. First, quality: Debian would be developed with the greatest care, to be worthy of the Linux kernel. It would also be a non-commercial distribution, sufficiently credible to compete with major commercial distributions. This double ambition would, in his eyes, only be achieved by opening the Debian development process just like that of Linux and the GNU project. Thus, peer review would continuously improve the product."
msgstr "当他在自由软件基金会（FSF）的领导下于1993年创建 Debian 时，Ian Murdock 有清晰的目标，他在 <emphasis>Debian Manifesto</emphasis> 中对其作了阐述。他所追求的自由操作系统将有两个首要的特性。第一点是质量：Debian 将在最大的关怀与努力下进行开发，以与 Linux 内核相配。另外，它同样将是一个非商业化的发行版，足够可靠而能够和主流商业发行版相竞争。在他眼里，这两个雄心壮志只能以开放 Debian 开发过程的方式达成，正如 Linux 和 GNU 工程所做的那样。因此，互帮互查将能够持续地改进这个项目。"

msgid "Ian Murdock, founder of the Debian project, was its first leader, from 1993 to 1996. After passing the baton to Bruce Perens, Ian took a less public role. He returned to working behind the scenes of the free software community, creating the Progeny company, with the intention of marketing a distribution derived from Debian. This venture was, sadly, a commercial failure, and development was abandoned. The company, after several years of scraping by, simply as a service provider, eventually filed for bankruptcy in April of 2007. Of the various projects initiated by Progeny, only <emphasis>discover</emphasis> still remains. It is an automatic hardware detection tool."
msgstr "伊恩·默多克是 Debian 项目的创立者，也是该项目从1993年至1996年的第一任领导者。在把接力棒交给 Bruce Perens 之后，伊恩不经常参与公众活动。他回到了自由软件社区的背后工作，为了尝试商业发行一个 Debian 的衍生发行版建立了 Progeny 公司。遗憾的是，这次冒险尝试是一个商业失败，开发活动也被放弃了。公司在经历了几年的摸爬滚打之后，以一个服务提供商的身份最终于2007年的4月破产。在 Progeny 发起的各个项目中，只有 <emphasis>discover</emphasis> 继续存在。这是一个自动硬件检查工具。"

msgid "Debian, remaining true to its initial principles, has had so much success that, today, it has reached a tremendous size. The 12 architectures offered cover 10 hardware architectures and 2 kernels (Linux and FreeBSD, although the FreeBSD-based ports are not part of the set of officially supported architectures). Furthermore, with more than 21,000 source packages, the available software can meet almost any need that one could have, whether at home or in the enterprise."
msgstr "Debian 依然坚持初衷，伴随诸多的成功以达到巨大的规模。它所提供的12个架构包括10个硬件架构和2个内核（Linux 与 FreeBSD，尽管基于 FreeBSD 的版本不在官方支持架构集合之内）。此外有超过21,000软件包适用于各种需求，不管是家用级的还是企业级的。"

msgid "The sheer size of the distribution can be inconvenient: it is really unreasonable to distribute 84 CD-ROMs to install a complete version on a standard PC… This is why Debian is increasingly considered as a “meta-distribution”, from which one extracts more specific distributions intended for a particular public: Debian-Desktop for traditional office use, Debian-Edu for education and pedagogical use in an academic environment, Debian-Med for medical applications, Debian-Junior for young children, etc. A more complete list of the subprojects can be found in the section dedicated to that purpose, see <xref linkend=\"sect.sub-projects\" />."
msgstr "发行版的超大体积很不方便：用84张 CD-ROM 光盘在标准个人电脑上安装完整的版本是很不合理的……这就是 Debian 渐渐被看作所谓“超发行版”的原因，人们可以从中抽取针对特别受众的特定版本：用于传统办公的 Debian-Desktop 版本，用于学术环境的教育与教学的 Debian-Edu 版本，用于医学应用的 Debian-Med 版本，供青少年使用的 Debian-Junior 版本，等等。更完整的子项目清单可在专门的章节找到，请参阅 <xref linkend=\"sect.sub-projects\" />。"

msgid "These partial views of Debian are organized in a well-defined framework, thus guaranteeing hassle-free compatibility between the various “sub-distributions”. All of them follow the general planning for release of new versions. And since they build on the same foundations, they can be easily extended, completed, and personalized with applications available in the Debian repositories."
msgstr "这些 Debian 的组成部分由定义清晰的框架组织而成，保证“子发行版”之间互相兼容、互不干扰。它们都采用一致的方案释放出新版本。同时它们都基于相同的基础构建而成，可以轻松地使用 Debian 仓库中的软件进行扩展、完善和个性化配置。"

msgstr "所有 Debian 的工具都遵循这个指导方向：<command>debian-cd</command> 已经存在很长时间了，它可以用来创建一组光盘，其中仅包含一系列预先选择的软件包；<command>debian-installer</command> 也是一个模块化的安装工具，易于适应不同的需求。<command>APT</command> 可以使用不同的来源安装软件包，同时保证系统整体的一致性。"

msgid "The term “architecture” indicates a type of computer (the most known include Mac or PC). Each architecture is differentiated primarily according to its processor, usually incompatible with other processors. These differences in hardware involve varying means of operation, thus requiring that software be compiled specifically for each architecture."
msgstr "术语 “architecture（架构）” 表明了计算机的类型（最为人所知的就是 Mac 或是 PC 了）。每一种架构的主要区别在于它使用的处理器，通常不同的处理器之间是不能兼容的。这些硬件的不同包含了大量不同的操作方法，因此需要为每种不同的架构分别编译软件。"

msgstr "Debian 项目中可获取的大多数的软件都是用可移植编程语言编写的：相同的源代码可以为不同的架构编译。事实上，一个可执行的二进制文件，通常都是为特定的架构编译的，在不同的架构的机器上几乎不能起任何作用。"

msgid "Recall that each program is created by writing source code; this source code is a text file composed of instructions in a given programming language. Before you can use the software, it is necessary to compile the source code, which means transforming the code into a binary (a series of machine instructions executable by the processor). Each programming language has a specific compiler to execute this operation (for example, <command>gcc</command> for the C programming language)."
msgstr "重申每一个程序是由源代码编写而成的；这些源代码就是包含了各种所使用的编程语言的指令的文本文件。在你可以使用软件之前，源代码需要被编译，目的是把代码转换成二进制文件（一系列处理器可以执行的机器指令）。每一种编程语言都有一个特定的编译器来执行这个操作（例如：<command>gcc</command> 是C语言的编译器）。"

msgstr "自由软件的质量"

msgid "Debian follows all of the principles of Free Software, and its new versions are not released until they are ready. Developers are not forced by some set schedule to rush to meet an arbitrary deadline. People frequently complain of the long time between Debian's stable releases, but this caution also ensures Debian's legendary reliability: long months of testing are indeed necessary for the full distribution to receive the “stable” label."
msgstr "Debian 遵循所有的自由软件的原则，在充分准备好之前新版本不会释出。开发者不会因为一些时间表而被强制的跟随一个随意的截止日期。人们经常抱怨 Debian 的稳定释出之间的时间间隔过长，但是这样的谨慎同样也保证了 Debian 一贯的可靠性：在赋予全发行版“稳定”标签之前长时间的测试确实是必要的。"

msgid "Debian will not compromise on quality: all known critical bugs are resolved in any new version, even if this requires the initially forecast release date to be pushed back."
msgstr "Debian 不会在质量问题上妥协：众所周知严重的 bug 都会在新版本中得到解决，即使需要推迟已经公布的释出日期。"

msgid "Debian doesn't own any server in its own name, since it is only a project within the <emphasis>Software in the Public Interest</emphasis> association, and SPI manages the hardware and financial aspects (donations, purchase of hardware, etc.). While initially created specifically for the Debian project, this association now hosts other free software projects, especially the PostgreSQL database, Freedesktop.org (project for standardization of various parts of modern graphical desktop environments, such as GNOME and KDE), and the Libre Office office suite. <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"http://www.spi-inc.org/\" />"
msgstr "在 Debian 的名下不拥有任何的服务器，因为它只是一个 <emphasis>Software in the Public Interest</emphasis> 协会内的项目，并且由 SPI 进行硬件管理与财务管理（捐赠，支付硬件费用等）。SPI 在一开始设立的时候只是为了 Debian 项目，这个协会现在也主持着其它的软件项目，尤其是 PostgreSQL 数据库，Freedesktop.org（为了标准化现代桌面图形化环境的各个部分的项目，如GNOME与KDE）和 Libre Office 办公套件。<ulink type=\"block\" url=\"http://www.spi-inc.org/\" />"

msgid "In addition to SPI, various local associations collaborate closely with Debian in order to generate funds for Debian, without centralizing everything in the USA: they are known as “Trusted Organizations” in the Debian jargon. This setup avoids prohibitive international transfer costs, and fits well with the decentralized nature of the project."
msgstr "在 SPI 之外，各种地区协会与 Debian 密切协作来为 Debian 项目筹措资金，使得不必要所有事情都集中在美国；在 Debian 项目的语汇中这些协会被称作 “可信组织” 。这样的设置避免了过高的国际交流成本，同时也契合了项目本身的去中心化的理念。"

msgid "While the list of trusted organizations is rather short, there are many more Debian-related associations whose goal is to promote Debian: <emphasis>Debian France</emphasis>, <emphasis>Debian-ES</emphasis>, <emphasis>debian.ch</emphasis>, and others around the world. Do not hesitate to join your local association and support the project! <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"http://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Auditor/Organizations\" /> <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"http://france.debian.net/\" /> <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"http://www.debian-es.org/\" /> <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"http://debian.ch/\" />"

This deliberately activist decision allows orderly and peaceful growth by ensuring that all members progress in the same direction. To become a Debian developer, any candidate must confirm and prove their support and adherence to the principles established in the project's Foundation Documents."
msgstr "在项目发起的几年之后，Debian 确定了需要遵循自由软件项目形式的原则。这个慎重而积极的决定使得项目有序而稳定的成长并且确保了所有的成员向同一个方向前进。要成为一个 Debian 的开发者，任何的候选人必须承诺并且证明他们能够支持并且坚守建立在项目的基础文档上的原则。"

msgid "The development process is constantly debated, but these Foundation Documents are widely and consensually supported, thus rarely change. The Debian constitution also offers other guarantees for their stability: a three-quarters qualified majority is required to approve any amendment."
msgstr "开发程序被不断的争论，然而这些基础文档被广泛的接受，因此很少更改。Debian 的组织架构也为这些稳定性提供了额外的保证：任何修订案都需要获得四分之三的有效多数的同意才能获得通过。"

msgstr "这个项目同样也有一份“社会契约”。这样一个文本在这个项目中只是为了一个操作系统的开发而存在的么？答案很简单：Debian 为用户工作，更广泛的来说，是为了这个社会。这份契约总结了这个项目所承担的承诺。让我们从更详细的细节中来学习它们："

msgid "Debian will remain 100% free."
msgstr "Debian 将始终是 100% 的自由软件。"

msgid "This is Rule No. 1. Debian is and will remain composed entirely and exclusively of free software. Additionally, all software development within the Debian project, itself, will be free."

msgid "<emphasis>PERSPECTIVE</emphasis> Beyond software"
msgstr "<emphasis>视角</emphasis> 在软件之外"

msgid "The first version of the Debian Social Contract said “Debian Will Remain 100% Free <emphasis>Software</emphasis>”. The disappearance of this word (with the ratification of Version 1.1 of the contract in April of 2004) indicates the will to achieve freedom, not only in software, but also in the documentation and any other element that Debian wishes to provide within its operating system."
msgstr "第一版的 Debian 社会契约告诉我们“Debian 将会始终保持100%的自由<emphasis>软件</emphasis>”。软件这个词的弃用（在2004年正式启用的1.1版社会契约中）指出了实现自由的愿景，不仅仅是在软件上，也同时在 Debian 期望与操作系统一起提供的文档和其它的要素中。"

msgid "This change, which was only intended as editorial, has, in reality, had numerous consequences, especially with the removal of some problematic documentation. Furthermore, the increasing use of firmware in drivers poses problems: many are non-free, yet they are necessary for proper operation of the corresponding hardware."
msgstr "这个改变，仅仅是作为对编辑的影响，事实上，由数不清的影响，特别是要移除一些成问题的文档。此外，在驱动中使用固件的增长带来了问题：许多是非自由的，然而在适当的操作与固件的通信中又是必需的。"

msgid "We will give back to the free software community."
msgstr "我们会回馈自由软件社区。"

msgid "Any improvement contributed by the Debian project to a work integrated in the distribution is sent back to the author of the work (called “upstream”). In general, Debian will cooperate with the community rather than work in isolation."
msgstr "任何被整合到发行版中的由 Debian 项目贡献的改进都会被反馈到作者（称为“上游”）。通常的，Debian 会与社区合作而不是独立工作。"

msgid "<primary>upstream</primary>"
msgstr "<primary>上游</primary>"

msgid "The term “upstream author” means the author(s)/developer(s) of a work, those who write and develop it. On the other hand, a “Debian developer” uses an existing work to make it into a Debian package (the term “Debian maintainer” is better suited)."
msgstr "术语“上游作者”指的是工作中的作者/开发者，是编写与开发软件的人员。另一方面，“Debian 开发者”使用更直观的工作来使软件加入到 Debian 包中（术语“Debian 维护者”更为适当一些）。"

msgid "In practice, the distinction is often not as clear-cut. The Debian maintainer may write a patch, which benefits all users of the work. In general, Debian encourages those in charge of a package in Debian to get involved in “upstream” development as well (they become, then, contributors, without being confined to the role of simple users of a program)."
msgstr "在实践中，区分往往不是那么的清晰。Debian 维护者可能会写一个补丁，这样的工作可以使所有人都受益。通常来讲，Debian 鼓励负责 Debian 中对应软件包的人员同时参与到“上游”开发工作中去（然后，他们也就变成了贡献者，而不是仅仅被限制为一个程序使用者的角色）。"

msgid "We will not hide problems."

msgid "Our priorities are our users and free software."
msgstr "用户和自由软件是我们优先考虑的事。"

msgid "This commitment is more difficult to define. Debian imposes, thus, a bias when a decision must be made, and will discard an easy solution for the developers that will jeopardize the user experience, opting for a more elegant solution, even if it is more difficult to implement. This means to take into account, as a priority, the interests of the users and free software."
msgstr "这个承诺更加难以定义。Debian 规定，如下，当必须要作一个带有一定偏向的决定时，会抛弃那个对开发来说更为方便而会损害用户体验的方案，选择一个更加优雅的方案，即使它会更加的难以实现。这意味着用户与自由软件的利益将会被优先考虑。"

msgid "Works that do not meet our free software standards."
msgstr "不符合我们的自由软件规范的作品。"

msgid "Debian accepts and understands that users may want to use some non-free programs. That's why the project allows usage of parts of its infrastructure to distribute Debian packages of non-free software that can safely be redistributed."
msgstr "Debian 接受并且理解用户可能需要使用一些非自由软件程序。这就是 Debian 允许混合使用了项目中的部分基础架构与非自由软件的程序可以被安全的再次分发的原因。"

msgid "The commitment to maintain a structure to accommodate non-free software (i.e. the “non-free” section, see the sidebar <xref linkend=\"sidebar.sections\" />) is frequently a subject of debate within the Debian community."
msgstr "维护一个允许容纳非自由软件的体系的承诺（如“non-free”章节，请看侧边栏<xref linkend=\"sidebar.sections\" />）总是 Debian 社区中的辩论的主题。"

msgid "Detractors argue that it turns people away from free software equivalents, and contradicts the principle of serving only the free software cause. Supporters flatly state that most of the non-free packages are “nearly free”, and held back by only one or two annoying restrictions (the most common being the prohibition against commercial usage of the software). By distributing these works in the non-free branch, we indirectly explain to the author that their creation would be better known and more widely used if they could be included in the main section. They are, thus, politely invited to alter their license to serve this purpose."
msgstr "反对者指责这相当于让人们远离自由软件，同时这也与只服务于自由软件的原则相背。支持者总是声称大多数的非自由软件包都是“几乎是自由的”，仅仅是被一两条恼人的限制性条件所限制（最常见的就是禁止软件的商业使用）。通过在非自由分支中分发这些软件包，我们相当于间接的向作者解释，如果这些软件包能被包含在主分区中，便可以被更多的人所知并且使用。因此，我们是在礼貌而委婉地提出希望他们能够为了达到这样的目的而改变其许可证。"

msgid "After a first, unfruitful attempt in 2004, the complete removal of the non-free section is unlikely to return to the agenda, especially since it contains many useful documents that were moved simply because they did not meet the new requirements for the main section. This is especially the case for certain software documentation files issued by the GNU project (in particular, Emacs and Make)."
msgstr "经过2004年首次不成功的尝试后，对不自由分区的彻底移除已经不太可能再次提上日程了。其中一个有很重要的原因，是这个分区包含了许多仅仅是因为不满足主分区新的要求而被移动至此的重要文档。对GNU计划所提供的某些软件文档来说尤其如此（特指Emacs和Make）。"

msgid "The continued existence of the non-free section is a source of occasional friction with the Free Software Foundation, and is the main reason it refuses to officially recommend Debian as an operating system."
msgstr "non-free软件分区就这样一直存在，并成为了与自由软件基金会之间不时产生摩擦的导火索。这也是基金会拒绝正式推荐Debian作为自由软件操作系统的主要原因。"

msgid "The GNU GPL, used and promoted by the FSF (Free Software Foundation), is the most common. Its main feature is that it also applies to any derived work that is redistributed: a program incorporating or using GPL code can only be distributed according to its terms. It prohibits, thus, any reuse in a proprietary application. This poses serious problems for the reuse of GPL code in free software incompatible with this license. As such, it is sometimes impossible to link a program published under another free software license with a library distributed under the GPL. On the other hand, this license is very solid in American law: FSF lawyers have participated in the drafting thereof, and have often forced violators to reach an amicable agreement with the FSF without going to court. <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html\" />"

It is, also, a play of words on the term “copyright”. Richard Stallman discovered the idea when a friend of his, fond of puns, wrote on an envelope addressed to him: “copyleft: all rights reversed”. Copyleft imposes preservation of all initial liberties upon distribution of an original or modified version of a work (usually a program). It is, thus, not possible to distribute a program as proprietary software if it is derived from code from a copyleft released program."
msgstr "著佐权的原则在于使用著作权来保障作品及其衍生品的自由，而不是如同专有软件的情况那样限制使用的权利。它也是对“著佐权”术语的文字游戏。Richard Stallman 从他的喜欢说双关语的朋友给他写的一封信那里获得了这一灵感，信的内容是这样的：“著佐权：所有权利反转”。著佐权强制保护原始作品（通常是程序）或者修改的作品版本分发的最初的自由。如果某一程序的代码是基于著佐权发布下的程序衍生而来的，那么它就不可能作为专有程序再被分发。"

msgid "The most well-known family of copyleft licenses is, of course, the GNU GPL and its derivatives, the GNU LGPL or GNU Lesser General Public License, and the GNU FDL or GNU Free Documentation License.

This leader's role is not formally defined by any document: candidates for this post usually propose their own definition of the position.

This amounts roughly to three years of support for each release. The Debian LTS team handles the last (two) years of security support so that each releases benefits from at least 5 years of support and so that users can upgrade from version N to N+2. <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"https://wiki.debian.org/LTS\" />"
