msgid "It is quite common, for an administrator who has been handling Debian packages in a regular fashion, to eventually feel the need to create their own packages, or to modify an existing package. This chapter aims to answer the most common questions in this field, and provide the required elements to take advantage of the Debian infrastructure in the best way. With any luck, after trying your hand for local packages, you may even feel the need to go further than that and join the Debian project itself!"
msgstr "对于以常规方式处理Debian软件包的管理员来说，最终觉得需要创建自己的软件包或修改现有软件包是很常见的。本章旨在回答本领域最常见的问题，并提供必要的元素以最好的方式利用Debian基础设施。在尝试你的本地包后，我希望你甚至可能觉得需要去更进一步并加入Debian项目！"

msgid "Rebuilding a Package from its Sources"
msgstr "从源码重建安装包"

msgid "Rebuilding a binary package is required under several sets of circumstances. In some cases, the administrator needs a software feature that requires the software to be compiled from sources, with a particular compilation option; in others, the software as packaged in the installed version of Debian is not recent enough. In the latter case, the administrator will usually build a more recent package taken from a newer version of Debian — such as <emphasis role=\"distribution\">Testing</emphasis> or even <emphasis role=\"distribution\">Unstable</emphasis> — so that this new package works in their <emphasis role=\"distribution\">Stable</emphasis> distribution; this operation is called “backporting”. As usual, care should be taken, before undertaking such a task, to check whether it has been done already — a quick look on the Debian Package Tracker for that package will reveal that information. <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"https://tracker.debian.org/\" /> <indexterm><primary>backport</primary></indexterm>"
msgstr "在几种情况下需要重建二进制包。在某些情况下，管理员需要一个软件功能，需要使用特定的编译选项从源编译软件;还有一些情况，安装在Debian上的版本不够新。在后一种情况下，管理员通常将从较新版本的Debian构建一个更新的包 — 例如<emphasis role=\"distribution\">Testing</emphasis>或者<emphasis role=\"distribution\">Unstable</emphasis>，这样新的包可工作在<emphasis role=\"distribution\">Stable</emphasis>上；这种操作被称之为 “backporting”。在执行这样的任务之前，通常应该小心检查是否有人已经做过了 - 在Debian Package Tracker 快速查看将显示该信息。 <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"https://tracker.debian.org/\" /> <indexterm><primary>backport</primary></indexterm>"

msgid "Getting the Sources"
msgstr "获取源代码"

msgid "Rebuilding a Debian package starts with getting its source code. The easiest way is to use the <command>apt-get source <replaceable>source-package-name</replaceable></command> command. This command requires a <literal>deb-src</literal> line in the <filename>/etc/apt/sources.list</filename> file, and up-to-date index files (i.e. <command>apt-get update</command>). These conditions should already be met if you followed the instructions from the chapter dealing with APT configuration (see <xref linkend=\"sect.apt-sources.list\" />). Note however, that you will be downloading the source packages from the Debian version mentioned in the <literal>deb-src</literal> line. If you need another version, you may need to download it manually from a Debian mirror or from the web site. This involves fetching two or three files (with extensions <filename>*.dsc</filename> — for <emphasis>Debian Source Control</emphasis> — <filename>*.tar.<replaceable>comp</replaceable></filename>, and sometimes <filename>*.diff.gz</filename> or <filename>*.debian.tar.<replaceable>comp</replaceable></filename> — <replaceable>comp</replaceable> taking one value among <literal>gz</literal>, <literal>bz2</literal> or <literal>xz</literal> depending on the compression tool in use), then run the <command>dpkg-source -x <replaceable>file.dsc</replaceable></command> command. If the <filename>*.dsc</filename> file is directly accessible at a given URL, there is an even simpler way to fetch it all, with the <command>dget <replaceable>URL</replaceable></command> command. This command (which can be found in the <emphasis role=\"pkg\">devscripts</emphasis> package) fetches the <filename>*.dsc</filename> file at the given address, then analyzes its contents, and automatically fetches the file or files referenced within. Once everything has been downloaded, it extracts the source package (unless the <literal>-d</literal> or <literal>--download-only</literal> option is used)."

msgstr "现在包的代码在以源包及其版本命名的目录中（例如，<emphasis>samba-4.1.17+dfsg</emphasis>);这是我们将处理本地更改的地方。"

msgid "The first thing to do is to change the package version number, so that the rebuilt packages can be distinguished from the original packages provided by Debian. Assuming the current version is <literal>2:4.1.17+dfsg-2</literal>, we can create version <literal>2:4.1.17+dfsg-2falcot1</literal>, which clearly indicates the origin of the package. This makes the package version number higher than the one provided by Debian, so that the package will easily install as an update to the original package. Such a change is best effected with the <command>dch</command> command (<emphasis>Debian CHangelog</emphasis>) from the <emphasis role=\"pkg\">devscripts</emphasis> package, with an command such as <command>dch --local falcot</command>. This invokes a text editor (<command>sensible-editor</command> — this should be your favorite editor if it is mentioned in the <varname>VISUAL</varname> or <varname>EDITOR</varname> environment variables, and the default editor otherwise) to allow documenting the differences brought by this rebuild. This editor shows us that <command>dch</command> really did change the <filename>debian/changelog</filename> file."
msgstr ""

msgid "When a change in build options is required, the changes need to be made in <filename>debian/rules</filename>, which drives the steps in the package build process. In the simplest cases, the lines concerning the initial configuration (<literal>./configure …</literal>) or the actual build (<literal>$(MAKE) …</literal> or <literal>make …</literal>) are easy to spot. If these commands are not explicitly called, they are probably a side effect of another explicit command, in which case please refer to their documentation to learn more about how to change the default behavior. With packages using <command>dh</command>, you might need to add an override for the <command>dh_auto_configure</command> or <command>dh_auto_build</command> commands (see their respective manual pages for explanations on how to achieve this)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Depending on the local changes to the packages, an update may also be required in the <filename>debian/control</filename> file, which contains a description of the generated packages. In particular, this file contains <literal>Build-Depends</literal> lines controlling the list of dependencies that must be fulfilled at package build time. These often refer to versions of packages contained in the distribution the source package comes from, but which may not be available in the distribution used for the rebuild. There is no automated way to determine if a dependency is real or only specified to guarantee that the build should only be attempted with the latest version of a library — this is the only available way to force an <emphasis>autobuilder</emphasis> to use a given package version during build, which is why Debian maintainers frequently use strictly versioned build-dependencies."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you know for sure that these build-dependencies are too strict, you should feel free to relax them locally. Reading the files which document the standard way of building the software — these files are often called <filename>INSTALL</filename> — will help you figure out the appropriate dependencies. Ideally, all dependencies should be satisfiable from the distribution used for the rebuild; if they are not, a recursive process starts, whereby the packages mentioned in the <literal>Build-Depends</literal> field must be backported before the target package can be. Some packages may not need backporting, and can be installed as-is during the build process (a notable example is <emphasis role=\"pkg\">debhelper</emphasis>). Note that the backporting process can quickly become complex if you are not careful. Therefore, backports should be kept to a strict minimum when possible."

However, building the whole package under this user would imply increased risks; fortunately, this can be avoided with the <command>fakeroot</command> command. This tool can be used to run a program and give it the impression that it runs as <emphasis>root</emphasis> and creates files with arbitrary ownership and permissions. When the program creates the archive that will become the Debian package, it is tricked into creating an archive containing files marked as belonging to arbitrary owners, including <emphasis>root</emphasis>. This setup is so convenient that <command>dpkg-buildpackage</command> uses <command>fakeroot</command> by default when building packages."
msgstr ""

msgid "Note that the program is only tricked into “believing” that it operates as a privileged account, and the process actually runs as the user running <command>fakeroot <replaceable>program</replaceable></command> (and the files are actually created with that user's permissions). At no time does it actually get root privileges that it could abuse."

In such a case, it is possible to overrule this check by passing the <literal>-d</literal> option to <command>dpkg-buildpackage</command>. However, explicitly ignoring these dependencies runs the risk of the build process failing at a later stage. Worse, the package may seem to build correctly but fail to run properly: some programs automatically disable some of their features when a required library is not available at build time."
msgstr ""

msgid "More often than not, Debian developers use a higher-level program such as <command>debuild</command>; this runs <command>dpkg-buildpackage</command> as usual, but it also adds an invocation of a program that runs many checks to validate the generated package against the Debian policy. This script also cleans up the environment so that local environment variables do not “pollute” the package build. The <command>debuild</command> command is one of the tools in the <emphasis>devscripts</emphasis> suite, which share some consistency and configuration to make the maintainers' task easier."

This directory is then used as the root directory (<filename>/</filename>), using the <command>chroot</command> command, during the build process."
msgstr ""

msgid "This tool allows the build process to happen in an environment that is not altered by users' manipulations. This also allows for quick detection of the missing build-dependencies (since the build will fail unless the appropriate dependencies are documented). Finally, it allows building a package for a Debian version that is not the one used by the system as a whole: the machine can be using <emphasis role=\"distribution\">Stable</emphasis> for its normal workload, and a <command>pbuilder</command> running on the same machine can be using <emphasis role=\"distribution\">Unstable</emphasis> for package builds."

msgstr ""

msgid "The purpose of a fake package is to trick <command>dpkg</command> and <command>apt</command> into believing that some package is installed even though it's only an empty shell. This allows satisfying dependencies on a package when the corresponding software was installed outside the scope of the packaging system. Such a method works, but it should still be avoided whenever possible, since there is no guarantee that the manually installed software behaves exactly like the corresponding package would and other packages depending on it would not work properly."
msgstr ""

msgid "On the other hand, a meta-package exists mostly as a collection of dependencies, so that installing the meta-package will actually bring in a set of other packages in a single step."
