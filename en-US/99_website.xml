      continued maintenance either by buying a paperback copy or by making

      The PDF format is the document corresponding to the printed book.
      It's not suitable for reading on small screens. The EPUB format is
      the recommended format if your reading devices supports it (most
      smartphones and many ebook readers do support it). The Mobipocket
      format is mainly for ebook readers that do not support EPUB (like
      the Kindle).
