  <title>Derivative Distributions</title>
  <highlights>
    <para><indexterm><primary>derivative distribution</primary></indexterm>
    <indexterm><primary>distribution, derivative</primary></indexterm> Many
    Linux distributions are derivatives of Debian and reuse Debian's
    package management tools. They all have their own interesting
    properties, and it is possible one of them will fulfill your needs
    better than Debian itself.</para>
  </highlights>
  <section id="sect.derivative-census">
    <title>Census and Cooperation</title>

    <para>The Debian project fully acknowledges the importance of
    derivative distributions and actively supports collaboration between
    all involved parties. This usually involves merging back the
    improvements initially developed by derivative distributions so that
    everyone can benefit and long-term maintenance work is reduced.</para>

    <para>This explains why derivative distributions are invited to become
    involved in discussions on the
    <literal>debian-derivatives@lists.debian.org</literal> mailing-list,
    and to participate in the derivative census. This census aims at
    collecting information on work happening in a derivative so that
    official Debian maintainers can better track the state of their package
    in Debian variants. <ulink type="block"

    <para>Let us now briefly describe the most interesting and popular
    derivative distributions.</para>
  </section>
  <section id="sect.ubuntu">
    <title>Ubuntu</title>
    <indexterm><primary>Ubuntu</primary></indexterm>

    <para>Ubuntu made quite a splash when it came on the Free Software
    scene, and for good reason: Canonical Ltd., the company that created
    this distribution, started by hiring thirty-odd Debian developers and
    publicly stating the far-reaching objective of providing a
    distribution for the general public with a new release twice a year.
    They also committed to maintaining each version for a year and a half.
    </para>

    <para>These objectives necessarily involve a reduction in scope; Ubuntu
    focuses on a smaller number of packages than Debian, and relies
    primarily on the GNOME desktop (although an official Ubuntu derivative,
    called “Kubuntu”, relies on KDE). Everything is internationalized and
    made available in a great many languages.</para>
    <indexterm><primary>Kubuntu</primary></indexterm>

    <para>So far, Ubuntu has managed to keep this release rhythm. They
    also publish <emphasis>Long Term Support</emphasis> (LTS)
    releases, with a 5-year maintenance promise. As of April 2015, the
    current LTS version is version 14.04, nicknamed Utopic
    Unicorn. The last non-LTS version is version 15.04, nicknamed
    Vivid Vervet. Version numbers describe the release date: 15.04,
    for example, was released in April 2015.</para>

    <sidebar>
      <title><emphasis>IN PRACTICE</emphasis> Ubuntu's support and maintenance promise</title>

      <indexterm><primary><literal>universe</literal></primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary><literal>multiverse</literal></primary></indexterm>

      <para>Canonical has adjusted multiple times the rules governing
      the length of the period during which a given release is
      maintained. Canonical, as a company, promises to provide security
      updates to all the software available in the <literal>main</literal>
      and <literal>restricted</literal> sections of the Ubuntu archive, for
      5 years for LTS releases and for 9 months for non-LTS releases.
      Everything else (available in the <literal>universe</literal>
      and <literal>multiverse</literal>) is maintained on a best-effort
      basis by volunteers of the MOTU team (<emphasis>Masters Of The
      Universe</emphasis>). Be prepared to handle security support yourself
      if you rely on packages of the latter sections.</para>
    </sidebar>

    <para>Ubuntu has reached a wide audience in the general public.
    Millions of users were impressed by its ease of installation, and the
    work that went into making the desktop simpler to use.</para>

    <para>Ubuntu and Debian used to have a tense relationship; Debian
    developers who had placed great hopes in Ubuntu contributing
    directly to Debian were disappointed by the difference between the
    Canonical marketing, which implied Ubuntu were good citizens in
    the Free Software world, and the actual practice where they simply
    made public the changes they applied to Debian packages.  Things
    have been getting better over the years, and Ubuntu has now made
    it general practice to forward patches to the most appropriate
    place (although this only applies to external software they
    package and not to the Ubuntu-specific software such as Mir or
    Unity). <ulink type="block" url="http://www.ubuntu.com/"/></para>
  </section>
  <section id="sect.linux-mint">
    <title>Linux Mint</title>
    <indexterm><primary>Linux Mint</primary></indexterm>

    <para>Linux Mint is a (partly) community-maintained distribution,
    supported by donations and advertisements. Their flagship product is
    based on Ubuntu, but they also provide a “Linux Mint Debian Edition”
    variant that evolves continuously (as it is based on Debian Testing).
    In both cases, the initial installation involves booting a
    LiveDVD.</para>

    <para>The distribution aims at simplifying access to advanced
    technologies, and provides specific graphical user interfaces on
    top of the usual software. For instance, Linux Mint relies on Cinnamon
    instead of GNOME by default (but it also includes MATE as well
    as KDE and Xfce); similarly, the package management
    interface, although based on APT, provides a specific interface
    with an evaluation of the risk from each package update.</para>

    <para>Linux Mint includes a large amount of proprietary software
    to improve the experience of users who might need those. For
    example: Adobe Flash and multimedia codecs.  <ulink type="block"

  <section id="sect.knoppix">
    <title>Knoppix</title>
    <indexterm><primary><foreignphrase>LiveCD</foreignphrase></primary></indexterm>
    <indexterm><primary>Knoppix</primary></indexterm>
    <indexterm><primary>bootable CD-ROM</primary></indexterm>
    <indexterm><primary>CD-ROM</primary><secondary>bootable</secondary></indexterm>
   
    <para>The Knoppix distribution barely needs an introduction. It
    was the first popular distribution to provide a
    <emphasis>LiveCD</emphasis>; in other words, a bootable CD-ROM
    that runs a turn-key Linux system with no requirement for a
    hard-disk — any system already installed on the machine will be
    left untouched. Automatic detection of available devices allows
    this distribution to work in most hardware configurations. The
    CD-ROM includes almost 2 GB of (compressed) software, and the
    DVD-ROM version has even more.</para>

    <para>Combining this CD-ROM to a USB stick allows carrying your
    files with you, and to work on any computer without leaving a
    trace — remember that the distribution doesn't use the hard-disk
    at all.  Knoppix uses LXDE (a lightweight graphical desktop) by
    default, but the DVD version also includes GNOME and KDE.  Many
    other distributions provide other combinations of desktops and
    software. This is, in part, made possible thanks to the <emphasis
    role="pkg">live-build</emphasis> Debian package that makes it
    relatively easy to create a LiveCD. <ulink type="block"
    url="http://live.debian.net/"/></para>
    <indexterm><primary><emphasis
    role="pkg">live-build</emphasis></primary></indexterm>

    <para>Note that Knoppix also provides an installer: you can first try
    the distribution as a LiveCD, then install it on a hard-disk to get
    better performance. <ulink type="block"

    <indexterm><primary>Aptosid</primary></indexterm> 
    <indexterm><primary>Siduction</primary></indexterm> 

    <para>These community-based distributions track the changes in
    Debian <emphasis role="distribution">Sid</emphasis> (<emphasis
    role="distribution">Unstable</emphasis>) — hence their name. The
    modifications are limited in scope: the goal is to provide the
    most recent software and to update drivers for the most recent
    hardware, while still allowing users to switch back to the
    official Debian distribution at any time. Aptosid was previously
    known as Sidux, and Siduction is a more recent fork of
    Aptosid.

  <section id="sect.grml">
    <title>Grml</title>
    <indexterm><primary>Grml</primary></indexterm>

    <para>Grml is a LiveCD with many tools for system administrators, dealing
    with installation, deployment, and system rescue. The LiveCD is provided
    in two flavors, <literal>full</literal> and <literal>small</literal>, both
    available for 32-bit and 64-bit PCs. Obviously, the two flavors differ
    by the amount of software included and by the resulting size.

  <section id="sect.tails">
    <title>Tails</title>
    <indexterm><primary>Tails</primary></indexterm>

    <para>Tails (The Amnesic Incognito Live System) aims at providing
    a live system that preserves anonymity and privacy.  It takes
    great care in not leaving any trace on the computer it runs on,
    and uses the Tor network to connect to the Internet in the most
    anonymous way possible.  <ulink type="block"

    <indexterm><primary>forensics</primary></indexterm>

    <para>Kali Linux is a Debian-based distribution specialising in
    penetration testing (“pentesting” for short).  It provides
    software that helps auditing the security of an existing network
    or computer while it is live, and analyze it after an attack
    (which is known as “computer forensics”). <ulink type="block"

  <section id="sect.devuan">
    <title>Devuan</title>
    <indexterm><primary>Devuan</primary></indexterm>

    <para>Devuan is a relatively new fork of Debian: it started in
    2014 as a reaction to the decision made by Debian to switch to
    <command>systemd</command> as the default init system.  A group of
    users attached to <command>sysv</command> and opposing (real or
    perceived) drawbacks to <command>systemd</command> started Devuan
    with the objective of maintaining a
    <command>systemd</command>-less system.  As of March 2015, they
    haven't published any real release: it remains to be seen if the
    project will succeed and find its niche, or if the systemd
    opponents will learn to accept it.

  <section id="sect.tanglu">
    <title>Tanglu</title>
    <indexterm><primary>Tanglu</primary></indexterm>

    <para>Tanglu is another Debian derivative; this one is based on a
    mix of Debian <emphasis role="distribution">Testing</emphasis> and
    <emphasis role="distribution">Unstable</emphasis>, with patches to
    some packages. Its goal is to provide a modern desktop-friendly
    distribution based on fresh software, without the release
    constraints of Debian.  <ulink type="block"

  <section id="sect.doudoulinux">
    <title>DoudouLinux</title>
    <indexterm><primary>DoudouLinux</primary></indexterm>

    <para>DoudouLinux targets young children (starting from 2 years old).
    To achieve this goal, it provides an heavily customized graphical
    interface (based on LXDE) and comes with many games and educative
    applications.  Internet access is filtered to prevent children from
    visiting problematic websites. Advertisements are blocked. The goal is
    that parents should be free to let their children use their computer
    once booted into DoudouLinux. And children should love using
    DoudouLinux, just like they enjoy their gaming console.

  <section id="sect.raspbian">
    <title>Raspbian</title>
    <indexterm><primary>Raspbian</primary></indexterm>
    <indexterm><primary>Raspberry Pi</primary></indexterm>

    <para>Raspbian is a rebuild of Debian optimised for the popular
    (and inexpensive) Raspberry Pi family of single-board computers.
    The hardware for that platform is more powerful than what the
    Debian <emphasis role="architecture">armel</emphasis> architecture
    can take advantage of, but lacks some features that would be
    required for <emphasis role="architecture">armhf</emphasis>; so
    Raspbian is a kind of intermediary, rebuilt specifically for that
    hardware and including patches targeting this computer only.

  <section id="sect.other-derivatives">
    <title>And Many More</title>
    <indexterm><primary>Distrowatch</primary></indexterm>

    <para>The Distrowatch website references a huge number of Linux
    distributions, many of which are based on Debian. Browsing this site is
    a great way to get a sense of the diversity in the Free Software world.
    <ulink type="block" url="http://distrowatch.com"/></para>

    <para>The search form can help track down a distribution based on its
