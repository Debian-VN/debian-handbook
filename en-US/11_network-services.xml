    <para>Network services are the programs that users interact with
    directly in their daily work. They are the tip of the information system
    iceberg, and this chapter focuses on them; the hidden parts they rely
    on are the infrastructure we already described.</para>

    <!-- TODO: #800968 - add a section or appendix on TLS,
                         replace para below -->
    <para>Many modern network services require encryption technology to
    operate reliably and securely, especially when used on the public
    Internet.  X.509 Certificates (which may also be referred to as
    SSL Certificates or TLS Certificates) are frequently used for this
    purpose.  A certificate for a specific domain can often be shared
    between more than one of the services discussed in this chapter.

    <para>The Falcot Corp administrators selected Postfix for the
    electronic mail server, due to its reliability and its ease of
    configuration. Indeed, its design enforces that each task is
    implemented in a process with the minimum set of required permissions,
    which is a great mitigation measure against security problems.</para>

      <title><emphasis>ALTERNATIVE</emphasis> The Exim4 server</title>
      <indexterm><primary>Exim</primary></indexterm>

      <para>Debian uses Exim4 as the default email server (which is why the
      initial installation includes Exim4). The configuration is provided
      by a separate package, <emphasis role="pkg">exim4-config</emphasis>,
      and automatically customized based on the answers to a set of Debconf
      questions very similar to the questions asked by the <emphasis
      role="pkg">postfix</emphasis> package.</para>

      <para>The configuration can be either in one single file
      (<filename>/etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template</filename>) or split across
      a number of configuration snippets stored under
      <filename>/etc/exim4/conf.d/</filename>. In both cases, the files are
      used by <command>update-exim4.conf</command> as templates to generate
      <filename>/var/lib/exim4/config.autogenerated</filename>.
      The latter is the file used by Exim4. Thanks to this mechanism,
      values obtained through Exim's debconf configuration — which are stored
      in <filename>/etc/exim4/update-exim4.conf.conf</filename> — can be
      injected in Exim's configuration file, even when the administrator or
      another package has altered the default Exim configuration.</para>

      <para>The Exim4 configuration file syntax has its peculiarities and
      its learning curve; however, once these peculiarities are understood,
      Exim4 is a very complete and powerful email server, as evidenced by
      the tens of pages of documentation.

      <title>Installing Postfix</title>

      <para>The <emphasis role="pkg">postfix</emphasis> package includes
      the main SMTP daemon. Other packages (such as <emphasis
      role="pkg">postfix-ldap</emphasis> and <emphasis
      role="pkg">postfix-pgsql</emphasis>) add extra functionality to
      Postfix, including access to mapping databases. You should only
      install them if you know that you need them.</para>

      <sidebar id="sidebar.smtp">
        <title><emphasis>BACK TO BASICS</emphasis> SMTP</title>

        <indexterm><primary>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol</primary></indexterm>
        <indexterm><primary>server</primary><secondary>SMTP</secondary></indexterm>

	<para>SMTP (<emphasis>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol</emphasis>) is
	the protocol used by mail servers to exchange and route
	emails.</para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>Several Debconf questions are asked during the installation of
      the package. The answers allow generating a first version of the
      <filename>/etc/postfix/main.cf</filename> configuration file.</para>

      <para>The first question deals with the type of setup. Only two of
      the proposed answers are relevant in case of an Internet-connected
      server, “Internet site” and “Internet with smarthost”. The
      former is appropriate for a server that receives incoming email and
      sends outgoing email directly to its recipients, and is therefore
      well-adapted to the Falcot Corp case. The latter is appropriate for a
      server receiving incoming email normally, but that sends outgoing
      email through an intermediate SMTP server — the “smarthost” —
      rather than directly to the recipient's server. This is mostly useful
      for individuals with a dynamic IP address, since many email servers
      reject messages coming straight from such an IP address. In this
      case, the smarthost will usually be the ISP's SMTP server, which is
      always configured to accept email coming from the ISP's customers and
      forward it appropriately. This setup (with a smarthost) is also
      relevant for servers that are not permanently connected to the
      internet, since it avoids having to manage a queue of undeliverable
      messages that need to be retried later.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title><emphasis>VOCABULARY</emphasis> ISP</title>
        <indexterm><primary>ISP, Internet Service Provider</primary></indexterm>

	<para>ISP is the acronym for “Internet Service Provider”. It
	covers an entity, often a commercial company, that provides
	Internet connections and the associated basic services (email, news
	and so on).</para>

        <para/>
      </sidebar>

      <para>The second question deals with the full name of the machine,
      used to generate email addresses from a local user name; the full
      name of the machine ends up as the part after the at-sign (“@”).
      In the case of Falcot, the answer should be
      <literal>mail.falcot.com</literal>. This is the only question asked
      by default, but the configuration it leads to is not complete enough
      for the needs of Falcot, which is why the administrators run
      <command>dpkg-reconfigure postfix</command> so as to be able to
      customize more parameters.</para>

      <para>One of the extra questions asks for all the domain names
      related to this machine. The default list includes its full name as
      well as a few synonyms for <literal>localhost</literal>, but the main
      <literal>falcot.com</literal> domain needs to be added by hand. More
      generally, this question should usually be answered with all the
      domain names for which this machine should serve as an MX server; in
      other words, all the domain names for which the DNS says that this machine
      will accept email. This information ends up in the
      <literal>mydestination</literal> variable of the main Postfix
      configuration file — <filename>/etc/postfix/main.cf</filename>.</para>

        <title><emphasis>EXTRA</emphasis> Querying the MX records</title>

	<para>When the DNS does not have an MX record for a domain, the
	email server will try sending the messages to the host itself, by
	using the matching A record (or AAAA in IPv6).</para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>In some cases, the installation can also ask what networks
      should be allowed to send email via the machine. In its default
      configuration, Postfix only accepts emails coming from the machine
      itself; the local network will usually be added. The Falcot Corp
      administrators added <literal>192.168.0.0/16</literal> to the default
      answer. If the question is not asked, the relevant variable in the
      configuration file is <literal>mynetworks</literal>, as seen in the
      example below.</para>

      <para>Local email can also be delivered through
      <command>procmail</command>. This tool allows users to sort their
      incoming email according to rules stored in their
      <filename>~/.procmailrc</filename> file.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>virtual domain</primary></indexterm>

      <para>The mail server can receive emails addressed to other domains
      besides the main domain; these are then known as virtual domains. In
      most cases where this happens, the emails are not ultimately destined
      to local users. Postfix provides two interesting features for
      handling virtual domains.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title><emphasis>CAUTION</emphasis> Virtual domains and canonical domains</title>

	<para>None of the virtual domains must be referenced in the
	<literal>mydestination</literal> variable; this variable only

        <indexterm><primary>alias</primary><secondary>virtual alias domain</secondary></indexterm>
        <indexterm><primary>virtual domain</primary><secondary>virtual alias domain</secondary></indexterm>

	<para>A virtual alias domain only contains aliases, i.e. addresses
	that only forward emails to other addresses.</para>

	<para>Such a domain is enabled by adding its name to the
	<literal>virtual_alias_domains</literal> variable, and referencing
	an address mapping file in the
	<literal>virtual_alias_maps</literal> variable.</para>

        <example>
          <title>Directives to add in the <filename>/etc/postfix/main.cf</filename> file</title>

virtual_alias_domains = falcotsbrand.com
virtual_alias_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/virtual
</programlisting>
        </example>

	<para>The <filename>/etc/postfix/virtual</filename> file
	describes a mapping with a rather straightforward syntax: each
	line contains two fields separated by whitespace; the first
	field is the alias name, the second field is a list of email
	addresses where it redirects. The special
	<literal>@domain.com</literal> syntax covers all remaining
	aliases in a domain.</para>

        <title>Virtual Mailbox Domains</title>

        <sidebar>
          <title><emphasis>CAUTION</emphasis> Combined virtual domain?</title>

	  <para>Postfix does not allow using the same domain in both
	  <literal>virtual_alias_domains</literal> and
	  <literal>virtual_mailbox_domains</literal>. However, every domain
	  of <literal>virtual_mailbox_domains</literal> is implicitly
	  included in <literal>virtual_alias_domains</literal>, which makes
	  it possible to mix aliases and mailboxes within a virtual
	  domain.</para>
        </sidebar>

        <indexterm><primary>mailbox, virtual domain</primary></indexterm>
	<indexterm><primary>virtual domain</primary><secondary>virtual mailbox domain</secondary></indexterm>

	<para>Messages addressed to a virtual mailbox domain are stored in
	mailboxes not assigned to a local system user.</para>

	<para>Enabling a virtual mailbox domain requires naming this domain
	in the <literal>virtual_mailbox_domains</literal> variable, and
	referencing a mailbox mapping file in
	<literal>virtual_mailbox_maps</literal>. The
	<literal>virtual_mailbox_base</literal> parameter contains the
	directory under which the mailboxes will be stored.</para>

	<para>The <literal>virtual_uid_maps</literal> parameter
	(respectively <literal>virtual_gid_maps</literal>) references the
	file containing the mapping between the email address and the
	system user (respectively group) that “owns” the corresponding
	mailbox. To get all mailboxes owned by the same owner/group, the
	<literal>static:5000</literal> syntax assigns a fixed UID/GID
	(of value 5000 here).</para>

        <example>
          <title>Directives to add in the <filename>/etc/postfix/main.cf</filename> file</title>

          <programlisting>
virtual_mailbox_domains = falcot.org
virtual_mailbox_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/vmailbox
virtual_mailbox_base = /var/mail/vhosts
</programlisting>
        </example>

	<para>Again, the syntax of the
	<filename>/etc/postfix/vmailbox</filename> file is quite
	straightforward: two fields separated with whitespace. The first
	field is an email address within one of the virtual domains, and
	the second field is the location of the associated mailbox
	(relative to the directory specified in
	<emphasis>virtual_mailbox_base</emphasis>). If the mailbox name
	ends with a slash (<literal>/</literal>), the emails will be stored
	in the <emphasis>maildir</emphasis> format; otherwise, the
	traditional <emphasis>mbox</emphasis> format will be used. The
	<emphasis>maildir</emphasis> format uses a whole directory to store
	a mailbox, each individual message being stored in a separate file.
	In the <emphasis>mbox</emphasis> format, on the other hand, the
	whole mailbox is stored in one file, and each line starting with
	“<literal>From </literal>” (<literal>From</literal> followed
	by a space) signals the start of a new message.</para>

        <example>
          <title>The <filename>/etc/postfix/vmailbox</filename> file</title>

          <programlisting>
# Jean's email is stored as maildir, with
# one file per email in a dedicated directory

      <title>Restrictions for Receiving and Sending</title>

      <para>The growing number of unsolicited bulk emails
      (<emphasis>spam</emphasis>) requires being increasingly strict when
      deciding which emails a server should accept. This section presents
      some of the strategies included in Postfix.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title><emphasis>CULTURE</emphasis> The spam problem</title>
        <indexterm><primary>spam</primary></indexterm>

	<para>“Spam” is a generic term used to designate all the
	unsolicited commercial emails (also known as UCEs) that flood our
	electronic mailboxes; the unscrupulous individuals sending them are
	known as spammers. They care little about the nuisance they cause,
	since sending an email costs very little, and only a very small
	percentage of recipients need to be attracted by the offers for the
	spamming operation to make more money than it costs. The process is
	mostly automated, and any email address made public (for instance,
	on a web forum, or on the archives of a mailing list, or on a blog,
	and so on) will be discovered by the spammers' robots, and
	subjected to a never-ending stream of unsolicited messages.</para>

	<para>All system administrators try to face this nuisance with spam
	filters, but of course spammers keep adjusting to try to work
	around these filters. Some even rent networks of machines
	compromised by a worm from various crime syndicates. Recent
	statistics estimate that up to 95% of all emails circulating on the
	Internet are spam!</para>
      </sidebar>
      <section>
        <title>IP-Based Access Restrictions</title>

	<para>The <literal>smtpd_client_restrictions</literal> directive
	controls which machines are allowed to communicate with the email
	server.</para>

        <example>
          <title>Restrictions Based on Client Address</title>

          <programlisting>
smtpd_client_restrictions = permit_mynetworks,
    warn_if_reject reject_unknown_client,
    check_client_access hash:/etc/postfix/access_clientip,
    reject_rbl_client sbl-xbl.spamhaus.org,
    reject_rbl_client list.dsbl.org
</programlisting>
        </example>

	<para>When a variable contains a list of rules, as in the example
	above, these rules are evaluated in order, from the first to the
	last. Each rule can accept the message, reject it, or leave the
	decision to a following rule. As a consequence, order matters, and
	simply switching two rules can lead to a widely different
	behavior.</para>

	<para>The <literal>permit_mynetworks</literal> directive, used as
	the first rule, accepts all emails coming from a machine in the
	local network (as defined by the <emphasis>mynetworks</emphasis>
	configuration variable).</para>

	<para>The second directive would normally reject emails coming from
	machines without a completely valid DNS configuration. Such a valid
	configuration means that the IP address can be resolved to a name,
	and that this name, in turn, resolves to the IP address. This
	restriction is often too strict, since many email servers do not
	have a reverse DNS for their IP address. This explains why the
	Falcot administrators prepended the
	<literal>warn_if_reject</literal> modifier to the
	<literal>reject_unknown_client</literal> directive: this modifier
	turns the rejection into a simple warning recorded in the logs. The
	administrators can then keep an eye on the number of messages that
	would be rejected if the rule were actually enforced, and make an
	informed decision later if they wish to enable such
	enforcement.</para>

        <sidebar>
          <title><emphasis>TIP</emphasis> <emphasis>access</emphasis> tables</title>

	  <para>The restriction criteria include administrator-modifiable
	  tables listing combinations of senders, IP addresses, and allowed
	  or forbidden hostnames. These tables can be created from an
	  uncompressed copy of the
	  <filename>/usr/share/doc/postfix-doc/examples/access.gz</filename>
	  file. This model is self-documented in its comments, which means
	  each table describes its own syntax.</para>

	  <para>The <filename>/etc/postfix/access_clientip</filename> table
	  lists IP addresses and networks;
	  <filename>/etc/postfix/access_helo</filename> lists domain names;
	  <filename>/etc/postfix/access_sender</filename> contains sender
	  email addresses. All these files need to be turned into
	  hash-tables (a format optimized for fast access) after each
	  change, with the <command>postmap
	  /etc/postfix/<replaceable>file</replaceable></command>
	  command.</para>
        </sidebar>

	<para>The third directive allows the administrator to set up a
	blacklist and a whitelist of email servers, stored in the
	<filename>/etc/postfix/access_clientip</filename> file. Servers in
	the whitelist are considered as trusted, and the emails coming
	from there therefore do not go through the following filtering
	rules.</para>

	<para>The last two rules reject any message coming from a server
	listed in one of the indicated blacklists. RBL is an acronym for
	<emphasis>Remote Black List</emphasis>; there are several such
	lists, but they all list badly configured servers that spammers use
	to relay their emails, as well as unexpected mail relays such as
	machines infected with worms or viruses.</para>
        <indexterm><primary>RBL</primary></indexterm>
        <indexterm><primary>Remote Black List</primary></indexterm>

        <sidebar>
          <title><emphasis>TIP</emphasis> White list and RBLs</title>

	  <para>Blacklists sometimes include a legitimate server that has
	  been suffering an incident. In these situations, all emails
	  coming from one of these servers would be rejected unless the
	  server is listed in a whitelist defined by
	  <filename>/etc/postfix/access_clientip</filename>.</para>

	  <para>Prudence therefore recommends including in the whitelist
	  all the trusted servers from which many emails are usually
	  received.</para>

</programlisting>
        </example>

	<para>The first <literal>permit_mynetworks</literal> directive
	allows all machines on the local network to introduce themselves
	freely. This is important, because some email programs do not
	respect this part of the SMTP protocol adequately enough, and they
	can introduce themselves with nonsensical names.</para>

	<para>The <literal>reject_invalid_hostname</literal> rule rejects
	emails when the <literal>EHLO</literal> announce lists a
	syntactically incorrect hostname. The
	<literal>reject_non_fqdn_hostname</literal> rule rejects messages
	when the announced hostname is not a fully-qualified domain name
	(including a domain name as well as a host name). The
	<literal>reject_unknown_hostname</literal> rule rejects messages if
	the announced name does not exist in the DNS. Since this last rule
	unfortunately leads to too many rejections, the administrators
	turned its effect to a simple warning with the
	<literal>warn_if_reject</literal> modifier as a first step; they
	may decide to remove this modifier at a later stage, after auditing
	the results of this rule.</para>

	<para>Using <literal>permit_mynetworks</literal> as the first rule
	has an interesting side effect: the following rules only apply to
	hosts outside the local network. This allows blacklisting all hosts
	that announce themselves as part of the
	<literal>falcot.com</literal>, for instance by adding a
	<literal>falcot.com REJECT You are not in our network!</literal>
	line to the <filename>/etc/postfix/access_helo</filename>
	file.</para>

        <title>Accepting or Refusing Based on the Announced Sender</title>

	<para>Every message has a sender, announced by the <literal>MAIL
	FROM</literal> command of the SMTP protocol; again, this
	information can be validated in several different ways.</para>
        <indexterm><primary><literal>MAIL FROM</literal></primary></indexterm>
        <indexterm><primary>email</primary><secondary>filtering on the sender</secondary></indexterm>

        <example>
          <title>Sender checks</title>

          <programlisting>
smtpd_sender_restrictions = 
    check_sender_access hash:/etc/postfix/access_sender,
    reject_unknown_sender_domain, reject_unlisted_sender,
    reject_non_fqdn_sender
</programlisting>
        </example>

	<para>The <filename>/etc/postfix/access_sender</filename> table
	maps some special treatment to some senders. This usually means
	listing some senders into a white list or a black list.</para>

	<para>The <literal>reject_unknown_sender_domain</literal> rule
	requires a valid sender domain, since it is needed for a valid
	address. The <literal>reject_unlisted_sender</literal> rule rejects
	local senders if the address does not exist; this prevents emails
	from being sent from an invalid address in the
	<literal>falcot.com</literal> domain, and messages emanating from
	<literal>joe.bloggs@falcot.com</literal> are only accepted if such
	an address really exists.</para>

	<para>Finally, the <literal>reject_non_fqdn_sender</literal> rule
	rejects emails purporting to come from addresses without a
	fully-qualified domain name. In practice, this means rejecting
	emails coming from <literal>user@machine</literal>: the address
	must be announced as either
	<literal>user@machine.example.com</literal> or
	<literal>user@example.com</literal>.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Accepting or Refusing Based on the Recipient</title>

	<para>Each email has at least one recipient, announced with the
	<literal>RCPT TO</literal> command in the SMTP protocol. These
	addresses also warrant validation, even if that may be less
	relevant than the checks made on the sender address.</para>
        <indexterm><primary>RCPT TO</primary></indexterm>
        <indexterm><primary>email</primary><secondary>filtering on the recipient</secondary></indexterm>

        <example>
          <title>Recipient checks</title>

          <programlisting>
smtpd_recipient_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, 
    reject_unauth_destination, reject_unlisted_recipient, 
    reject_non_fqdn_recipient
</programlisting>
        </example>

	<para><literal>reject_unauth_destination</literal> is the basic
	rule that requires outside messages to be addressed to us; messages
	sent to an address not served by this server are rejected. Without
	this rule, a server becomes an open relay that allows spammers to
	send unsolicited emails; this rule is therefore mandatory, and it
	will be best included near the beginning of the list, so that no
	other rules may authorize the message before its destination has
	been checked.</para>

	<para>The <literal>reject_unlisted_recipient</literal> rule rejects
	messages sent to non-existing local users, which makes sense.
	Finally, the <literal>reject_non_fqdn_recipient</literal> rule
	rejects non-fully-qualified addresses; this makes it impossible to
	send an email to <literal>jean</literal> or
	<literal>jean@machine</literal>, and requires using the full
	address instead, such as <literal>jean@machine.falcot.com</literal>
	or <literal>jean@falcot.com</literal>.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Restrictions Associated with the <literal>DATA</literal> Command</title>

	<para>The <literal>DATA</literal> command of SMTP is emitted before
	the contents of the message. It doesn't provide any information per
	se, apart from announcing what comes next. It can still be
	subjected to checks.</para>
        <indexterm><primary><literal>DATA</literal></primary></indexterm>

        <example>
          <title><literal>DATA</literal> checks</title>

          <programlisting>
smtpd_data_restrictions = reject_unauth_pipelining
</programlisting>
        </example>

	<para>The <literal>reject_unauth_pipelining</literal> directives
	causes the message to be rejected if the sending party sends a
	command before the reply to the previous command has been sent.
	This guards against a common optimization used by spammer robots,
	since they usually don't care a fig about replies and only focus on
	sending as many emails as possible in as short a time as
	possible.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Applying Restrictions</title>

	<para>Although the above commands validate information at various
	stages of the SMTP exchange, Postfix only sends the actual
	rejection as a reply to the <literal>RCPT TO</literal>
	command.</para>

	<para>This means that even if the message is rejected due to an
	invalid <literal>EHLO</literal> command, Postfix knows the sender
	and the recipient when announcing the rejection. It can then log a
	more explicit message than it could if the transaction had been
	interrupted from the start. In addition, a number of SMTP clients
	do not expect failures on the early SMTP commands, and these
	clients will be less disturbed by this late rejection.</para>

	<para>A final advantage to this choice is that the rules can
	accumulate information during the various stages of the SMTP exchange; this
	allows defining more fine-grained permissions, such as rejecting a
	non-local connection if it announces itself with a local
	sender.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Filtering Based on the Message Contents</title>

	<para>The validation and restriction system would not be complete
	without a way to apply checks to the message contents. Postfix
	differentiates the checks applying to the email headers from those
	applying to the email body.</para>

        <example>
          <title>Enabling content-based filters</title>

          <programlisting>

</programlisting>
        </example>
        <indexterm><primary>email</primary><secondary>filtering on contents</secondary></indexterm>

	<para>Both files contain a list of regular expressions (commonly
	known as <emphasis>regexps</emphasis> or
	<emphasis>regexes</emphasis>) and associated actions to be
	triggered when the email headers (or body) match the
	expression.</para>

        <sidebar>
          <title><emphasis>QUICK LOOK</emphasis> Regexp tables</title>

	  <para>The
	  <filename>/usr/share/doc/postfix-doc/examples/header_checks.gz</filename>
	  file contains many explanatory comments and can be used as a
	  starting point for creating the
	  <filename>/etc/postfix/header_checks</filename> and
	  <filename>/etc/postfix/body_checks</filename> files.</para>
        </sidebar>

        <example>
          <title>Example <filename>/etc/postfix/header_checks</filename> file</title>

          <programlisting>
/^X-Mailer: GOTO Sarbacane/ REJECT I fight spam (GOTO Sarbacane)
/^Subject: *Your email contains VIRUSES/ DISCARD virus notification
</programlisting>
        </example>

        <sidebar id="sidebar.regexp">
          <title><emphasis>BACK TO BASICS</emphasis> Regular expression</title>

	  <para>The <emphasis>regular expression</emphasis> term (shortened
	  to <emphasis>regexp</emphasis> or <emphasis>regex</emphasis>)
	  references a generic notation for expressing a description of the
	  contents and/or structure of a string of characters. Certain
	  special characters allow defining alternatives (for instance,
	  <literal>foo|bar</literal> matches either “foo” or
	  “bar”), sets of allowed characters (for instance,
	  <literal>[0-9]</literal> means any digit, and
	  <literal>.</literal> — a dot — means any character),
	  quantifications (<literal>s?</literal> matches either
	  <literal>s</literal> or the empty string, in other words 0 or 1
	  occurrence of <literal>s</literal>; <literal>s+</literal> matches
	  one or more consecutive <literal>s</literal> characters; and so
	  on). Parentheses allow grouping search results.</para>

	  <para>The precise syntax of these expressions varies across the
	  tools using them, but the basic features are similar. <ulink
	  type="block"
	  url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression"/></para>
        </sidebar>

	<para>The first one checks the header mentioning the email
	software; if <literal>GOTO Sarbacane</literal> (a bulk email
	software) is found, the message is rejected. The second expression
	controls the message subject; if it mentions a virus notification,
	we can decide not to reject the message but to discard it
	immediately instead.</para>

	<para>Using these filters is a double-edged sword, because it is
	easy to make the rules too generic and to lose legitimate emails as
	a consequence. In these cases, not only the messages will be lost,
	but their senders will get unwanted (and annoying) error
	messages.</para>

    <section id="sect.setting-up-greylisting">
      <title>Setting Up <foreignphrase>greylisting</foreignphrase></title>
      <indexterm><primary>greylisting</primary></indexterm>

      <para>“Greylisting” is a filtering technique according to which a
      message is initially rejected with a temporary error code, and only
      accepted on a further try after some delay. This filtering is
      particularly efficient against spam sent by the many machines
      infected by worms and viruses, since this software rarely acts as
      a full SMTP agent (by checking the error code and retrying failed
      messages later), especially since many of the harvested addresses are
      really invalid and retrying would only mean losing time.</para>

      <para>Postfix doesn't provide greylisting natively, but there is a
      feature by which the decision to accept or reject a given message can
      be delegated to an external program. The <emphasis
      role="pkg">postgrey</emphasis> package contains just such a program,
      designed to interface with this access policy delegation
      service.</para>

      <para>Once <emphasis role="pkg">postgrey</emphasis> is installed, it
      runs as a daemon and listens on port 10023. Postfix can then be
      configured to use it, by adding the
      <literal>check_policy_service</literal> parameter as an extra
      restriction:</para>

      <programlisting>
smtpd_recipient_restrictions = permit_mynetworks,
    [...]
    check_policy_service inet:127.0.0.1:10023
</programlisting>

      <para>Each time Postfix reaches this rule in the ruleset, it will
      connect to the <command>postgrey</command> daemon and send it
      information concerning the relevant message. On its side, Postgrey
      considers the IP address/sender/recipient triplet and checks in its
      database whether that same triplet has been seen recently. If so,
      Postgrey replies that the message should be accepted; if not, the
      reply indicates that the message should be temporarily rejected, and
      the triplet gets recorded in the database.</para>

      <para>The main disadvantage of greylisting is that legitimate
      messages get delayed, which is not always acceptable. It also
      increases the burden on servers that send many legitimate
      emails.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title><emphasis>IN PRACTICE</emphasis> Shortcomings of greylisting</title>

	<para>Theoretically, greylisting should only delay the first mail
	from a given sender to a given recipient, and the typical delay is
	in the order of minutes. Reality, however, can differ slightly.
	Some large ISPs use clusters of SMTP servers, and when a message is
	initially rejected, the server that retries the transmission may
	not be the same as the initial one. When that happens, the second
	server gets a temporary error message due to greylisting too, and
	so on; it may take several hours until transmission is attempted by
	a server that has already been involved, since SMTP servers usually
	increase the delay between retries at each failure.</para>

	<para>As a consequence, the incoming IP address may vary in time
	even for a single sender. But it goes further: even the sender
	address can change. For instance, many mailing-list servers encode
	extra information in the sender address so as to be able to handle
	error messages (known as <emphasis>bounces</emphasis>). Each new
	message sent to a mailing-list may then need to go through
	greylisting, which means it has to be stored (temporarily) on the
	sender's server. For very large mailing-lists (with tens of
	thousands of subscribers), this can soon become a problem.</para>

	<para>To mitigate these drawbacks, Postgrey manages a whitelist of
	such sites, and messages emanating from them are immediately
	accepted without going through greylisting. This list can easily be
	adapted to local needs, since it is stored in the
	<filename>/etc/postgrey/whitelist_clients</filename> file.</para>
      </sidebar>

      <sidebar>
        <title><emphasis>GOING FURTHER</emphasis> Selective greylisting with <emphasis role="pkg">milter-greylist</emphasis></title>

	<para>The drawbacks of greylisting can be mitigated by only using
	greylisting on the subset of clients that are already considered as
	probable sources of spam (because they are listed in a DNS
	blacklist). This is not possible with <emphasis role="pkg">postgrey</emphasis>
	but <emphasis role="pkg">milter-greylist</emphasis> can be used
	in such a way.</para>

	<para>In that scenario, since DNS blacklists never triggers a
	definitive rejection, it becomes reasonable to use aggressive
	blacklists, including those listing all dynamic IP addresses
	from ISP clients (such as <literal>pbl.spamhaus.org</literal>
	or <literal>dul.dnsbl.sorbs.net</literal>).</para>

	<para>Since milter-greylist uses Sendmail's milter interface, the
	postfix side of its configuration is limited to
        “<literal>smtpd_milters = unix:/var/run/milter-greylist/milter-greylist.sock</literal>”.

        and the numerous ways to configure milter-greylist. You will
        also have to edit <filename>/etc/default/milter-greylist</filename>

      <title>Customizing Filters Based On the Recipient</title>

      <para><xref linkend="sect.restrictions-for-receiving-and-sending"/> and
      <xref linkend="sect.setting-up-greylisting"/> reviewed many of the possible
      restrictions. They all have their use in limiting the amount of
      received spam, but they also all have their drawbacks. It is
      therefore more and more common to customize the set of filters
      depending on the recipient. At Falcot Corp, greylisting is
      interesting for most users, but it hinders the work of some users who
      need low latency in their emails (such as the technical support
      service). Similarly, the commercial service sometimes has problems
      receiving emails from some Asian providers who may be listed in
      blacklists; this service asked for a non-filtered address so as to
      be able to correspond.</para>

      <para>Postfix provides such a customization of filters with a
      “restriction class” concept. The classes are declared in the
      <literal>smtpd_restriction_classes</literal> parameter, and defined
      the same way as <literal>smtpd_recipient_restrictions</literal>. The
      <literal>check_recipient_access</literal> directive then defines a
      table mapping a given recipient to the appropriate set of
      restrictions.</para>

      <para>The Falcot administrators selected <command>clamav</command>

      <para>The task of interfacing between antivirus and the email server
      goes to <command>clamav-milter</command>. A
      <emphasis>milter</emphasis> (short for <emphasis>mail
      filter</emphasis>) is a filtering program specially designed to
      interface with email servers. A milter uses a standard application
      programming interface (API) that provides much better performance
      than filters external to the email servers. Milters were initially
      introduced by <emphasis>Sendmail</emphasis>, but

      <para>Once the <emphasis role="pkg">clamav-milter</emphasis> package is

      <sidebar>
        <title><emphasis>NOTE</emphasis> Real TCP port vs named socket</title>

    <section id="sect.authenticated-smtp">
      <title>Authenticated SMTP</title>

      <para>Being able to send emails requires an SMTP server to be
      reachable; it also requires said SMTP server to send emails through
      it. For roaming users, this may need regularly changing the
      configuration of the SMTP client, since Falcot's SMTP server rejects
      messages coming from IP addresses apparently not belonging to the
      company. Two solutions exist: either the roaming user installs an
      SMTP server on their computer, or they still use the company server
      with some means of authenticating as an employee. The former solution
      is not recommended since the computer won't be permanently connected,
      and it won't be able to retry sending messages in case of problems;
      we will focus on the latter solution.</para>

      <para>SMTP authentication in Postfix relies on SASL (<emphasis>Simple
      Authentication and Security Layer</emphasis>). It requires installing
      the <emphasis role="pkg">libsasl2-modules</emphasis> and <emphasis
      role="pkg">sasl2-bin</emphasis> packages, then registering a password
      in the SASL database for each user that needs authenticating on the
      SMTP server. This is done with the <command>saslpasswd2</command>
      command, which takes several parameters. The <literal>-u</literal>
      option defines the authentication domain, which must match the
      <literal>smtpd_sasl_local_domain</literal> parameter in the Postfix
      configuration. The <literal>-c</literal> option allows creating a
      user, and <literal>-f</literal> allows specifying the file to use if
      the SASL database needs to be stored at a different location than the
      default (<filename>/etc/sasldb2</filename>).</para>

      <screen role="scale">

<computeroutput>[... type jean's password twice ...]</computeroutput></screen>

      <para>Note that the SASL database was created in Postfix's directory.
      In order to ensure consistency, we also turn

      <para>
        Installing the <emphasis role="pkg">apache2</emphasis> package
        is all that is needed. It contains all the modules, including
        the <emphasis>Multi-Processing Modules</emphasis> (MPMs) that
        affect how Apache handles parallel processing of many requests
        (those used to be provided in separate <emphasis

        <emphasis role="pkg">apache2-utils</emphasis> containing the

      </para>

      <para>
        The MPM in use affects significantly the way Apache will handle
        concurrent requests. With the <emphasis>worker</emphasis> MPM, it
        uses <emphasis>threads</emphasis> (lightweight processes), whereas
        with the <emphasis>prefork</emphasis> MPM it uses a pool of

        it also uses threads, but the inactive connections (notably those

      <title>Configuring Virtual Hosts</title>

      <para>A virtual host is an extra identity for the web server.</para>
      <indexterm><primary>virtual host</primary></indexterm>

      <para>Apache considers two different kinds of virtual hosts: those
      that are based on the IP address (or the port), and those that rely
      on the domain name of the web server. The first method requires
      allocating a different IP address (or port) for each site, whereas
      the second one can work on a single IP address (and port), and the
      sites are differentiated by the hostname sent by the HTTP client
      (which only works in version 1.1 of the HTTP protocol — fortunately
      that version is old enough that all clients use it already).</para>

      <para>The (increasing) scarcity of IPv4 addresses usually favors the
      second method; however, it is made more complex if the virtual hosts
      need to provide HTTPS too, since the SSL protocol hasn't always
      provided for name-based virtual hosting; the SNI extension
      (<emphasis>Server Name Indication</emphasis>) that allows such a
      combination is not handled by all browsers. When several HTTPS sites
      need to run on the same server, they will usually be differentiated
      either by running on a different port or on a different IP address
      (IPv6 can help there).</para>

      <para>The default configuration for Apache 2 enables name-based
      virtual hosts.  In addition, a default virtual host is defined
      in the <literal>/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf</literal>
      file; this virtual host will be used if no host matching the
      request sent by the client is found.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title><emphasis>CAUTION</emphasis> First virtual host</title>

	<para>Requests concerning unknown virtual hosts will always be
	served by the first defined virtual host, which is why we defined
	<literal>www.falcot.com</literal> first here.</para>
      </sidebar>

      <sidebar>
        <title><emphasis>QUICK LOOK</emphasis> Apache supports SNI</title>
        <indexterm><primary>Server Name Indication</primary></indexterm>

	<para>The Apache server supports
	an SSL protocol extension called <emphasis>Server Name
	Indication</emphasis> (SNI). This extension allows the browser to
	send the hostname of the web server during the establishment of the
	SSL connection, much earlier than the HTTP request itself, which
	was previously used to identify the requested virtual host among
	those hosted on the same server (with the same IP address and
	port). This allows Apache to select the most appropriate SSL
	certificate for the transaction to proceed.</para>

	<para>Before SNI, Apache would always use the certificate defined
	in the default virtual host. Clients trying to access another
	virtual host would then display warnings, since the certificate
	they received didn't match the website they were trying to access.
	Fortunately, most browsers now work with SNI; this includes
	Microsoft Internet Explorer starting with version 7.0 (starting on
	Vista), Mozilla Firefox starting with version 2.0, Apple Safari
	since version 3.2.1, and all versions of Google Chrome.</para>

	<para>The Apache package provided in Debian is built with support
	for SNI; no particular configuration is therefore needed.</para>

	<para>Care should also be taken to ensure that the configuration
	for the first virtual host (the one used by default) does enable
	TLSv1, since Apache uses the parameters of this first virtual host
	to establish secure connections, and they had better allow
	them!</para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>Each extra virtual host is then described by a file stored in
      <filename>/etc/apache2/sites-available/</filename>. Setting up a
      website for the <literal>falcot.org</literal> domain is therefore a
      simple matter of creating the following file, then enabling the
      virtual host with <command>a2ensite www.falcot.org</command>.</para>

      <example>
        <title>The <filename>/etc/apache2/sites-available/www.falcot.org.conf</filename> file</title>

        <programlisting>
&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
ServerName www.falcot.org
ServerAlias falcot.org
DocumentRoot /srv/www/www.falcot.org
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>The Apache server, as configured so far, uses the same log
      files for all virtual hosts (although this could be changed by adding
      <literal>CustomLog</literal> directives in the definitions of the
      virtual hosts). It therefore makes good sense to customize the format
      of this log file to have it include the name of the virtual host.
      This can be done by creating a
      <filename>/etc/apache2/conf-available/customlog.conf</filename> file that defines
      a new format for all log files (with the <literal>LogFormat</literal>
      directive) and by enabling it with <command>a2enconf customlog</command>.
      The <literal>CustomLog</literal> line must also be
      removed (or commented out) from the
      <filename>/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf</filename>
      file.</para>

      <example>
        <title>The <filename>/etc/apache2/conf.d/customlog.conf</filename> file</title>

        <programlisting role="scale">
# New log format including (virtual) host name
LogFormat "%v %h %l %u %t \"%r\" %&gt;s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" vhost

# Now let's use this "vhost" format by default
CustomLog /var/log/apache2/access.log vhost
</programlisting>
      </example>

      <indexterm><primary>Apache directives</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>directives, Apache</primary></indexterm>

      <para>The main configuration file usually includes several
      <literal>Directory</literal> blocks; they allow specifying different
      behaviors for the server depending on the location of the file being
      served. Such a block commonly includes <literal>Options</literal> and

	<para>The <literal>Order</literal> directive tells the server of

      <title>Log Analyzers</title>

      <para>A log analyzer is frequently installed on a web server; since
      the former provides the administrators with a precise idea of the
      usage patterns of the latter.</para>

      <para>The Falcot Corp administrators selected
      <emphasis>AWStats</emphasis> (<emphasis>Advanced Web
      Statistics</emphasis>) to analyze their Apache log files.</para>
      <indexterm><primary><emphasis>AWStats</emphasis></primary></indexterm>

      <indexterm><primary>logs</primary><secondary>web logs analyzer</secondary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>analyzer of web logs</primary></indexterm>

      <para>The first configuration step is the customization of the
      <filename>/etc/awstats/awstats.conf</filename> file.
      The Falcot administrators keep it unchanged apart from the following
      parameters:</para>

      <programlisting>
LogFile="/var/log/apache2/access.log"
LogFormat = "%virtualname %host %other %logname %time1 %methodurl %code %bytesd %refererquot %uaquot"
SiteDomain="www.falcot.com"
HostAliases="falcot.com REGEX[^.*\.falcot\.com$]"
DNSLookup=1
LoadPlugin="tooltips"
</programlisting>

      <para>All these parameters are documented by comments in the template
      file. In particular, the <varname>LogFile</varname> and
      <varname>LogFormat</varname> parameters describe the location and
      format of the log file and the information it contains;
      <varname>SiteDomain</varname> and <varname>HostAliases</varname> list
      the various names under which the main web site is known.</para>

      <para>For high traffic sites, <varname>DNSLookup</varname> should
      usually not be set to <literal>1</literal>; for smaller sites, such
      as the Falcot one described above, this setting allows getting more
      readable reports that include full machine names instead of raw IP
      addresses.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title><emphasis>SECURITY</emphasis> Access to statistics</title>

	<para>AWStats makes its statistics available on the website with no
	restrictions by default, but restrictions can be set up so that
	only a few (probably internal) IP addresses can access them; the
	list of allowed IP addresses needs to be defined in the
	<varname>AllowAccessFromWebToFollowingIPAddresses</varname>
	parameter</para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>AWStats will also be enabled for other virtual hosts; each
      virtual host needs its own configuration file, such as
      <filename>/etc/awstats/awstats.www.falcot.org.conf</filename>.</para>

      <example>
        <title>AWStats configuration file for a virtual host</title>

</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>AWStats uses many icons stored in the
      <filename>/usr/share/awstats/icon/</filename> directory. In order for
      these icons to be available on the web site, the Apache configuration
      needs to be adapted to include the following directive:</para>

      <programlisting>

      <para>After a few minutes (and once the script has been run a few

        <title><emphasis>CAUTION</emphasis> Log file rotation</title>

	<para>In order for the statistics to take all the logs into

	the Apache log files are rotated. Looking at the <literal>prerotate</literal>
        directive of <filename>/etc/logrotate.d/apache2</filename> file,
	this can be solved by putting a symlink to

	<filename>/etc/logrotate.d/httpd-prerotate</filename>:</para>

        <screen><computeroutput>$ </computeroutput><userinput>cat /etc/logrotate.d/apache2

    <title>FTP File Server</title>
    <indexterm><primary>FTP (<emphasis>File Transfer Protocol</emphasis>)</primary></indexterm>

    <para>FTP (<emphasis>File Transfer Protocol</emphasis>) is one of the
    first protocols of the Internet (RFC 959 was issued in 1985!). It was
    used to distribute files before the Web was even born (the HTTP
    protocol was created in 1990, and formally defined in its 1.0 version
    by RFC 1945, issued in 1996).</para>

    <para>This protocol allows both file uploads and file downloads; for
    this reason, it is still widely used to deploy updates to a website
    hosted by one's Internet service provider (or any other entity hosting
    websites). In these cases, secure access is enforced with a user
    identifier and password; on successful authentication, the FTP server
    grants read-write access to that user's home directory.</para>

    <para>Other FTP servers are mainly used to distribute files for public
    downloading; Debian packages are a good example. The contents of these
    servers is fetched from other, geographically remote, servers; it is
    then made available to less distant users. This means that client
    authentication is not required; as a consequence, this operating mode
    is known as “anonymous FTP”. To be perfectly correct, the clients
    do authenticate with the <literal>anonymous</literal> username; the
    password is often, by convention, the user's email address, but the
    server ignores it.</para>

    <para>Many FTP servers are available in Debian (<emphasis
    role="pkg">ftpd</emphasis>, <emphasis role="pkg">proftpd-basic</emphasis>,
    <emphasis role="pkg">pyftpd</emphasis> and so on). The Falcot Corp
    administrators picked <emphasis role="pkg">vsftpd</emphasis> because
    they only use the FTP server to distribute a few files (including a
    Debian package repository); since they don't need advanced features,
    they chose to focus on the security aspects.</para>
    <indexterm><primary><emphasis role="pkg">vsftpd</emphasis></primary></indexterm>

    <para>Installing the package creates an <literal>ftp</literal> system
    user. This account is always used for anonymous FTP connections, and
    its home directory (<filename>/srv/ftp/</filename>) is the root of the
    tree made available to users connecting to this service. The default
    configuration (in <filename>/etc/vsftpd.conf</filename>) requires some
    changes to cater to the simple need of making big files available
    for public downloads: anonymous access needs to be enabled
    (<literal>anonymous_enable=YES</literal>) and read-only access of
    local users needs to be disabled (<literal>local_enable=NO</literal>).
    The latter is particularly important since the FTP protocol doesn't
    use any form of encryption and the user password could be intercepted
    over the wire.
    </para>

    <title>NFS File Server</title>

    <para>NFS (<emphasis>Network File System</emphasis>) is a protocol
    allowing remote access to a filesystem through the network. All Unix
    systems can work with this protocol; when Windows systems are involved,
    Samba must be used instead.</para>

    <para>NFS is a very useful tool but, historically, it has suffered from
    many limitations, most of which have been addressed with version 4 of
    the protocol. The downside is that the latest version of NFS is
    harder to configure when you want to make use of basic security
    features such as authentication and encryption since it relies on
    Kerberos for those parts. And without those, the NFS protocol must
    be restricted to a trusted local network since data goes over the
    network unencrypted (a <emphasis>sniffer</emphasis> can intercept it) and
    access rights are granted based on the client's IP address (which can be
    spoofed).</para>

      <indexterm><primary>NFS</primary><secondary>security</secondary></indexterm>

      <para>If you don't use the Kerberos-based security features, 
      it is vital to ensure that only the machines allowed to use NFS can
      connect to the various required RPC servers, because the basic
      protocol trusts the data received from the network. The firewall
      must also block <emphasis>IP spoofing</emphasis> so as to prevent an
      outside machine from acting as an inside one, and access to the
      appropriate ports must be restricted to the machines meant to access
      the NFS shares.</para>

	<para>RPC services register to a directory known as the

	query first addresses the <emphasis>portmapper</emphasis> (on port

	usually mentions port 2049 (the default for NFS). Not all RPC
	services necessarily use a fixed port.</para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>Older versions of the protocol required other RPC services which
      used dynamically assigned ports. Fortunately, with NFS version 4,
      only port 2049 (for NFS) and 111 (for the portmapper) are needed and
      they are thus easy to firewall.

    <section>
      <title>NFS Server</title>

      <para>The NFS server is part of the Linux kernel; in kernels provided
      by Debian it is built as a kernel module. If the NFS server is to be
      run automatically on boot, the <emphasis
      role="pkg">nfs-kernel-server</emphasis> package should be installed;
      it contains the relevant start-up scripts.</para>

      <para>The NFS server configuration file,
      <filename>/etc/exports</filename>, lists the directories that are
      made available over the network (<emphasis>exported</emphasis>). For
      each NFS share, only the given list of machines is granted access.
      More fine-grained access control can be obtained with a few options.
      The syntax for this file is quite simple:</para>
      <indexterm><primary><filename>exports</filename></primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary><filename>/etc/exports</filename></primary></indexterm>

      <programlisting>
/directory/to/share machine1(option1,option2,...) machine2(...) ...
</programlisting>

      <para>Note that with NFSv4, all exported directories must be part of
        a single hierarchy and that the root directory of that hierarchy
        must be exported and identified with the option <literal>fsid=0</literal>
        or <literal>fsid=root</literal>.
      </para>

      <para>Each machine can be identified either by its DNS name or its IP
      address. Whole sets of machines can also be specified using either a
      syntax such as <literal>*.falcot.com</literal> or an IP address range
      such as <literal>192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0</literal> or
      <literal>192.168.0.0/24</literal>.</para>

      <para>Directories are made available as read-only by default (or with
      the <literal>ro</literal> option). The <literal>rw</literal> option
      allows read-write access. NFS clients typically connect from a port
      restricted to root (in other words, below 1024); this restriction can
      be lifted by the <literal>insecure</literal> option (the
      <literal>secure</literal> option is implicit, but it can be made
      explicit if needed for clarity).</para>
      <indexterm><primary>NFS</primary><secondary>options</secondary></indexterm>

      <para>By default, the server only answers an NFS query when the
      current disk operation is complete (<literal>sync</literal> option);
      this can be disabled with the <literal>async</literal> option.
      Asynchronous writes increase performance a bit, but they decrease
      reliability since there is a data loss risk in case of the server
      crashing between the acknowledgment of the write and the actual
      write on disk. Since the default value changed recently (as compared
      to the historical value of NFS), an explicit setting is
      recommended.</para>

      <para>In order to not give root access to the filesystem to any NFS
      client, all queries appearing to come from a root user are considered
      by the server as coming from the <literal>nobody</literal> user.
      This behavior corresponds to the <literal>root_squash</literal>
      option, and is enabled by default. The
      <literal>no_root_squash</literal> option, which disables this
      behavior, is risky and should only be used in controlled
      environments. The
      <literal>anonuid=<replaceable>uid</replaceable></literal> and
      <literal>anongid=<replaceable>gid</replaceable></literal> options
      allow specifying another fake user to be used instead of
      UID/GID 65534 (which corresponds to user <literal>nobody</literal> and group
      <literal>nogroup</literal>).</para>

      <para>With NFSv4, you can add a <literal>sec</literal> option to
        indicate the security level that you want:
        <literal>sec=sys</literal> is the default with no special security
        features, <literal>sec=krb5</literal> enables authentication only,
        <literal>sec=krb5i</literal> adds integrity protection, and
        <literal>sec=krb5p</literal> is the most complete level which
        includes privacy protection (with data encryption). For this
        to work you need a working Kerberos setup (that service is not
        covered by this book).

      any <literal>setuid</literal> or <literal>setgid</literal> bit from
      programs stored on the share. If the NFS share is only meant to store

      <para>Prior to installing, care should be taken to check that the

      -f</command> must return a fully-qualified name (including a domain).
      If it does not, then the <filename>/etc/hosts</filename> file should
      be edited to contain the full name of the system (for instance,
      <literal>arrakis.falcot.com</literal>). The official computer name

      <title>Configuring a Filter</title>

      <para><command>squid</command> itself does not perform the filtering;
      this action is delegated to <command>squidGuard</command>. The former
      must then be configured to interact with the latter. This involves
      adding the following directive to the
      <filename>/etc/squid3/squid.conf</filename> file:</para>
      <indexterm><primary><command>squidGuard</command></primary></indexterm>

      <programlisting>
url_rewrite_program /usr/bin/squidGuard -c /etc/squid3/squidGuard.conf 
</programlisting>

      <para>The <filename>/usr/lib/cgi-bin/squidGuard.cgi</filename> CGI
      program also needs to be installed, using
      <filename>/usr/share/doc/squidguard/examples/squidGuard.cgi.gz</filename>
      as a starting point. Required modifications to this script are the
      <varname>$proxy</varname> and <varname>$proxymaster</varname>
      variables (the name of the proxy and the administrator's contact
      e-mail, respectively). The <varname>$image</varname> and
      <varname>$redirect</varname> variables should point to existing
      images representing the rejection of a query.</para>

      <para>The filter is enabled with the <command>service squid3
      reload</command> command. However, since the <emphasis
      role="pkg">squidguard</emphasis> package does no filtering by
      default, it is the administrator's task to define the policy. This
      can be done by creating the

      <filename>/etc/squidguard/squidGuard.conf.default</filename> as
      template if required).</para>

    <indexterm><primary>directory, LDAP</primary></indexterm>

    <para>OpenLDAP is an implementation of the LDAP protocol; in other
    words, it is a special-purpose database designed for storing
    directories. In the most common use case, using an LDAP server allows
    centralizing management of user accounts and the related permissions.
    Moreover, an LDAP database is easily replicated, which allows setting
    up multiple synchronized LDAP servers. When the network and the user
    base grows quickly, the load can then be balanced across several
    servers.</para>

    <para>LDAP data is structured and hierarchical. The structure is
    defined by “schemas” which describe the kind of objects that the
    database can store, with a list of all their possible attributes. The
    syntax used to refer to a particular object in the database is based on
    this structure, which explains its complexity.</para>

	  <para>The first step is to create a key pair (comprising a public

	  reuse <emphasis>easy-rsa</emphasis> to generate it (see
	  <xref linkend="sect.easy-rsa" />).

	  The answer to the “common name” question
	  <emphasis>must</emphasis> be the fully-qualified hostname for the
	  LDAP server; in our case,
	  <literal>ldap.falcot.com</literal>.</para>

	  <para>This command creates a certificate in the
	  <filename>keys/ldap.falcot.com.crt</filename> file; the corresponding private

	  <para>Now these keys have to be installed in their standard

SLAPD_SENTINEL_FILE=/etc/ldap/noslapd

# For Kerberos authentication (via SASL), slapd by default uses the system

    This chapter gives a brief introduction to three of the
    services required to operate RTC, including a TURN server,

      <para>JSCommunicator is a generic, unbranded WebRTC phone that does
      not require any server-side scripting such as PHP. It is built
      exclusively with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is the basis
      for many other WebRTC services and modules for more advanced
      web publishing frameworks.

      <para>The package
      <emphasis role="pkg">jscommunicator-web-phone</emphasis> is the
      quickest way to install a WebRTC phone into a web site.
      It requires a SIP proxy with a WebSocket transport. The instructions in
      <xref linkend="sect.sip-server-install"/> include the necessary
      details to enable the WebSocket transport in the
      <emphasis role="pkg">repro</emphasis> SIP proxy.</para>

      <para>After installing
      <emphasis role="pkg">jscommunicator-web-phone</emphasis>,
      there are various ways to use it. A simple strategy is to include
      or copy the configuration from
      <filename>/etc/jscommunicator-web-phone/apache.conf</filename>
      into an Apache virtual host configuration.</para>

      <para>Once the web-phone files are available in the web server,
      customize the
      <filename>/etc/jscommunicator-web-phone/config.js</filename> to point
      at the TURN server and SIP proxy. For example:</para>

<programlisting>
JSCommSettings = {

  // Web server environment
  webserver: {
    url_prefix: null            // If set, prefix used to construct sound/ URLs
  },

  // STUN/TURN media relays
  stun_servers: [],
  turn_servers: [
    { server:"turn:turn-server.falcot.com?transport=udp", username:"joe", password:"j0Ep455d" }
  ],

  // WebSocket connection
  websocket: {
      // Notice we use the falcot.com domain certificate and port 8443
      // This matches the Transport3 and Transport4 example in
      // the falcot.com repro.config file
    servers: 'wss://falcot.com:8443',
    connection_recovery_min_interval: 2,
    connection_recovery_max_interval: 30
  },

  ...

      <para>More advanced click-to-call web sites typically use server-side
