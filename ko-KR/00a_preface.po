msgid "Debian is a very successful operating system, which is pervasive in our digital lives more than people often imagine or are aware of. A few data points will suffice to make this clear. At the time of writing Debian is the most popular GNU/Linux variant among web servers: according to <ulink url=\"http://w3techs.com/\">W3Techs</ulink>, more than 10% of the web is Debian-powered. Think about it: how many web sites would have you missed today without Debian? Onto more fascinating deployments, Debian is the operating system of choice on the International Space Station. Have you been following the work of ISS astronauts, maybe via the social network presence of NASA or other international organizations? Both the work in itself and the posts about it have been made possible by Debian. Countless companies, universities, and public administrations rely on Debian daily for their operations, delivering services to millions of users around the world... and its orbit!"
msgstr "데비안 리눅스는 보통 사람들이 생각하는 것 이상으로 우리의 디지털 라이프 곳곳에 퍼져있는 아주 성공적인 운영체제입니다. 몇가지 측면에서 이 점은 확실하다고 할 수 있습니다. 데비안 리눅스는 여러 리눅스 배포본중에서도 가장 인기가 있는 웹 서버 운영체제로 이용되고 있는데, W3Techs에 의하면 10% 이상의 웹 사이트가 데비안 리눅스를 사용하고 있습니다. 만약 데비안이 존재하지 않았다면 얼마나 많은 웹 사이트가 없어지게 될지 한번 상상해 보세요. 좀 더 멋진 사례를 들자면, 데비안 리눅스는 국제 우주 정거장(ISS, International Space Station)에서도 사용되고 있습니다. 혹시 ISS 우주비행사들이 무슨 작업을 하는지 살펴본 적이 있나요? 이들의 업무는 NASA의 소셜 네트워크와 다른 국제 기구를 통해서 우리에게 알려지게 되는데 이 모든 일들은 데비안이 있기에 가능한 것입니다. 수많은 회사, 대학교, 공공기관이 그들의 일상적인 업무와 수백만 명의 사용자에게 서비스를 제공하기 위해 데비안 리눅스를 사용하고 있습니다. 심지어 우주 공간에서조차요!"

msgid "But Debian is much more than an operating system, no matter how complex, featureful, and reliable such a system could be. Debian is a vision of the freedoms that people should enjoy in a world where more and more of our daily activities depend on software. Debian is born from the cardinal Free Software idea that people should be in control of their computers, and not the other way around. People with enough software knowledge should be able to dismantle, modify, reassemble and share with others all the software that matters to them. It doesn't matter if the software is used for frivolous activities like posting pictures of kittens on the Web, or for potentially life-threatening tasks such as driving our cars and powering the medical devices which cure us — and Debian is used in all of the above scenarios; you should control it. People without in-depth software knowledge should enjoy those freedoms too: they should be able to delegate to people of their choice, people they trust, the audit or modification of software-based devices on their behalf."
msgstr "데비안 리눅스에는 운영체제가 지녀야 할 다양한 기능이나 안정성, 효율성 그 이상의 것이 담겨 있습니다. 데비안은 점점 더 많이 소프트웨어에 의존하게 되는 현대사회에서 사람들이 누릴 수 있는 자유에 대한 비젼입니다. 데비안은 컴퓨터를 이용하는 주체가 사용자여야한다는 자유 소프트웨어 이념을 바탕으로 탄생하였습니다. 소프트웨어에 대한 충분한 지식이 있는 사람들은 사용하고자 하는 소프트웨어에 대한 수정, 변경, 및 공유에 제약을 받지 않게 됩니다. 그 소프트웨어가 인터넷에 아기 고양이 사진을 올리는 사소한 일에 사용되는 것인지, 아니면 자동차 운전이라던가 사람을 치료하는 의료기기처럼 잠재적으로 사람의 생명에 위협을 줄 수 있는 데 쓰이는 것인지는 중요하지 않습니다. 사실 데비안은 이러한 모든 상황에서 사용되고 있으며, 그 주체는 사용자 당신입니다. 소프트웨어에 대한 깊은 지식이 없는 사람들 또한 이러한 자유를 충분히 누릴수 있습니다. 이들은 그들의 선택, 자신의 믿음, 소프트웨어가 사용되는 기기의 수정 및 교정에 대한 대리인이 될 수 있습니다."

msgid "In the quest for the control of people over machines, Free operating systems play a fundamental role: you cannot be in full control of a computer device if you do not control its operating system. This is where Debian's main ambition comes from: producing the best, entirely Free operating system. For more than 20 years now, Debian has both developed a Free operating system and promoted a vision of Free Software around it. In so doing, Debian has set a very high bar for software freedom advocates around the world. Debian's decisions on matters of software licensing, for example, are routinely looked to by international standard organizations, governments, and other Free Software projects, when deciding if something should be considered “free enough” or not."
msgstr ""

msgid "But this political vision is not yet enough to explain Debian's uniqueness. Debian is also a very peculiar social experiment, strongly attached to its independence. Think for a moment of other mainstream Free Software distributions, or even of popular <emphasis>proprietary</emphasis> operating systems. Chances are that you can associate each of them with a large company that is either the main development force behind the project, or at the very least the steward of all its non-development activities. Debian is different. Within the Debian Project volunteers pack on themselves the responsibilities of all the activities that are needed to keep Debian alive and kicking. The variety of those activities is stunning: from translations to system administration, from marketing to management, from conference organization to artwork design, from bookkeeping to legal issues... not to mention software packaging and development! Debian contributors take care of all of these."
msgstr ""

msgid "As a first consequence of this radical form of independence, Debian needs and relies on a very diverse community of volunteers. Any skill in any of the above areas, or others you can imagine, can be invested into Debian and will be used to improve the project. A second consequence of Debian independence is that Debian's choices can be trusted not to be driven by the commercial interests of specific companies — interests that we have no guarantee will always be aligned with the goal of promoting people's control over machines, as too many recent examples in the tech news testify."
msgstr ""

msgid "One last aspect contributes to Debian's uniqueness: the way in which the social experiment is run. Despite the folklore of being bureaucratic, decision making in Debian is in fact highly distributed. There exist clearly defined areas of responsibility within the project. People in charge of those areas are free to drive their own boat. As long as they keep up with the quality requirements agreed upon by the community, no one can tell them what to do or how to do their job. If you want to have a say on how something is done in Debian, you need to put yourself on the line and be ready to take the job on your shoulders. This peculiar form of meritocracy — which we sometimes call <emphasis>do-ocracy</emphasis> — is very empowering for contributors. Anyone with enough skills, time, and motivation can have a real impact on the direction the project is taking. This is testified by a population of about 1 000 official members of the Debian Project, and several thousands of contributors world-wide. It is no wonder that Debian is often credited as the largest community-driven Free Software project in existence."
msgstr ""

msgid "So Debian is quite unique. Are we the only ones noticing this? Definitely not. According to <ulink url=\"http://distrowatch.com/\">DistroWatch</ulink> there are about 300 active Free Software distributions around. Half of that (about 140) are Debian <emphasis>derivatives</emphasis>. That means that they start from Debian, adapt it to fit the needs of their users — usually by adding, modifying, and rebuilding packages — and release the resulting product. In essence, derivatives apply the Free Software granted freedoms of modifying and redistributing copies not only to individual pieces of software, but to a distribution as a whole. The potential of reaching out to new Free Software users and contributors by the means of derivative distributions is huge. We believe that it is mainly thanks to that thriving ecosystem that Free Software is nowadays finally rivaling with proprietary software in fields which were historically considered hard to conquer, such as large desktop deployments. Debian sits at the root of the largest ecosystem of Free Software distributions in existence: even if you are not using Debian directly, and even if your distributor has not told you, chances are that you are benefiting right now from the work of the Debian community."
msgstr ""

msgid "But Debian's uniqueness sometimes comes with unexpected consequences. A consequence of Debian's vision on digital freedoms has been the need of redefining what we mean by <emphasis>software</emphasis>. The Debian Project has since long realized that, as part of an operating system, you need to distribute a lot of non-software material: music, images, documentation, raw data, firmware, etc. But how do you apply <emphasis>software</emphasis> freedoms to that material? Should we have different requirements or should all material be held up to the same high standard of freedom? The Debian Project has decided for the latter: all material shipped as part of Debian should offer the same freedoms to its users. Such a radical philosophical position has far reaching effects. It means we cannot distribute non-free firmware, or artwork not meant to be used in commercial settings, or books that cannot be modified in order to avoid tarnishing (as book publishers folklore goes) the author's/publisher's reputation."
msgstr ""

msgid "The book you have in your hands is different. It's a <emphasis>free as in freedom</emphasis> book, a book which is up to Debian freedom standards for every aspect of your digital life. For a very long time, the scarce availability of books like this one has been a significant shortcoming of Debian. It meant that there was little reading material that helped to spread Debian and its values, while at the same time embodying those values and showing off their advantages. But it also meant, ironically, that we had little such material that we could distribute as part of Debian itself. This is the first reputable book to address this shortcoming. You can <command>apt install</command> this book, you can redistribute it, you can fork this book or, better, submit bug reports and patches for it, so that others in the future can benefit from your contributions. The “maintainers” of this book — who are also its authors — are longstanding members of the Debian Project, who grok the freedom ethos that permeates every aspect of Debian and know first-hand what it means to take on the responsibility for important parts of Debian. By releasing this Free book they are doing, once more, such a wonderful service to the Debian community."
