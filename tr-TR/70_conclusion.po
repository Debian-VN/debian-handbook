msgid "Conclusion: Debian's Future"
msgstr ""

msgid "The story of Falcot Corp ends with this last chapter; but Debian lives on, and the future will certainly bring many interesting surprises."
msgstr ""

msgid "Upcoming Developments"
msgstr ""

msgid "Weeks (or months) before a new version of Debian is released, the Release Manager picks the codename for the next version. Now that Debian version 8 is out, the developers are already busy working on the next version, codenamed <emphasis role=\"distribution\">Stretch</emphasis>…"
msgstr ""

msgid "There is no official list of planned changes, and Debian never makes promises relating to technical goals of the coming versions. However, a few development trends can already be noted, and we can try some bets on what might happen (or not)."
msgstr ""

msgid "In order to improve security and trust, most if not all the packages will be made to build reproducibly; that is to say, it will be possible to rebuild byte-for-byte identical binary packages from the source packages, thus allowing everyone to verify that no tampering has happened during the builds."
msgstr ""

msgid "In a related theme, a lot of effort will have gone into improving security by default, and mitigating both “traditional” attacks and the new threats implied by mass surveillance."
msgstr ""

msgid "Of course, all the main software suites will have had a major release. The latest version of the various desktops will bring better usability and new features. Wayland, the new display server that is being developed to replace X11 with a more modern alternative, will be available (although maybe not default) for at least some desktop environments."
msgstr ""

msgid "A new feature of the archive maintenance software, “bikesheds”, will allow developers to host special-purpose package repositories in addition to the main repositories; this will allow for personal package repositories, repositories for software not ready to go into the main archive, repositories for software that has only a very small audience, temporary repositories for testing new ideas, and so on."

msgid "Debian's Future"
msgstr ""

msgid "In addition to these internal developments, one can reasonably expect new Debian-based distributions to come to light, as many tools keep making this task easier. New specialized subprojects will also be started, in order to widen Debian's reach to new horizons."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Debian user community will increase, and new contributors will join the project… including, maybe, you!"
msgstr ""

msgid "The Debian project is stronger than ever, and well on its way towards its goal of a universal distribution; the inside joke within the Debian community is about <foreignphrase>World Domination</foreignphrase>."
msgstr ""

msgid "In spite of its old age and its respectable size, Debian keeps on growing in all kinds of (sometimes unexpected) directions. Contributors are teeming with ideas, and discussions on development mailing lists, even when they look like bickerings, keep increasing the momentum. Debian is sometimes compared to a black hole, of such density that any new free software project is attracted."
msgstr ""

msgid "Beyond the apparent satisfaction of most Debian users, a deep trend is becoming more and more indisputable: people are increasingly realising that collaborating, rather than working alone in their corner, leads to better results for everyone. Such is the rationale used by distributions merging into Debian by way of subprojects."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Debian project is therefore not threatened by extinction…"
msgstr ""

msgid "Future of this Book"
msgstr ""

msgid "We would like this book to evolve in the spirit of free software. We therefore welcome contributions, remarks, suggestions, and criticism. Please direct them to Raphaël (<email>hertzog@debian.org</email>) or Roland (<email>lolando@debian.org</email>). For actionable feedback, feel free to open bug reports against the <literal>debian-handbook</literal> Debian package. The website will be used to gather all information relevant to its evolution, and you will find there information on how to contribute, in particular if you want to translate this book to make it available to an even larger public than today. <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"http://debian-handbook.info/\" />"
msgstr ""

msgid "We tried to integrate most of what our experience at Debian taught us, so that anyone can use this distribution and take the best advantage of it as soon as possible. We hope this book contributes to making Debian less confusing and more popular, and we welcome publicity around it!"
msgstr ""

msgid "We would like to conclude on a personal note. Writing (and translating) this book took a considerable amount of time out of our usual professional activity. Since we are both freelance consultants, any new source of income grants us the freedom to spend more time improving Debian; we hope this book to be successful and to contribute to this. In the meantime, feel free to retain our services! <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"http://www.freexian.com\" /> <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"http://www.gnurandal.com\" />"
