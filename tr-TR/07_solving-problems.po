msgstr ""

msgid "This acronym stands for “Read the F***ing Manual”, but can also be expanded in a friendlier variant, “Read the Fine Manual”. This phrase is sometimes used in (terse) responses to questions from newbies. It is rather abrupt, and betrays a certain annoyance at a question asked by someone who has not even bothered to read the documentation. Some say that this classic response is better than no response at all (since it indicates that the documentation contains the information sought), or than a more verbose and angry answer."
msgstr ""

msgid "In any case, if someone responds “RTFM” to you, it is often wise not to take offense. Since this answer may be perceived as vexing, you might want to try and avoid receiving it. If the information that you need is not in the manual, which can happen, you might want to say so, preferably in your initial question. You should also describe the various steps that you have personally taken to find information before you raised a question on a forum. Following Eric Raymond's guidelines is a good way to avoid the most common mistakes and get useful answers. <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html\" />"

The <filename>changelog.Debian.gz</filename> file allows the user to follow the modifications made to the package over time: it is very useful to try to understand what has changed between two installed versions that do not have the same behavior.

A good mastery of search engines will prove immensely valuable to find relevant pages quickly (by restricting the search to the Internet domain or sub-domain dedicated to the program). If the search returns too many pages or if the results do not match what you seek, you can add the keyword <userinput>debian</userinput> to limit results and target relevant information."

msgstr ""

msgid "In other cases, you will get very general errors, such as “Permission denied”. In this case, it is best to check the permissions of the elements involved (files, user ID, groups, etc.)."

First, check if there is a <literal>Homepage</literal> field in the package's meta-information (<command>apt-cache show <replaceable>package</replaceable></command>). Alternately, the package description may contain a link to the program's official website. If no URL is indicated, look at <filename>/usr/share/doc/<replaceable>package</replaceable>/copyright</filename>. The Debian maintainer generally indicates in this file where they got the program's source code, and this is likely to be the website that you need to find. If at this stage your search is still unfruitful, consult a free software directory, such as FSF's Free Software Directory, or search directly with a search engine, such as Google, DuckDuckGo, Yahoo, etc. <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Main_Page\" />"

It is sometimes essential in order to understand the differences from the original behavior of the program, as described in the general documentation, such as howtos. Sometimes this file also details the most common errors in order for you to avoid wasting time on common problems."
msgstr ""

msgid "Then, you should look at the software's official documentation — refer to <xref linkend=\"sect.documentation-sources\" /> to identify the various existing documentation sources. The <command>dpkg -L <replaceable>package</replaceable></command> command gives a list of files included in the package; you can therefore quickly identify the available documentation (as well as the configuration files, located in <filename>/etc/</filename>). <command>dpkg -s <replaceable>package</replaceable></command> displays the package meta-data and shows any possible recommended or suggested packages; in there, you can find documentation or a utility that will ease the configuration of the software."
