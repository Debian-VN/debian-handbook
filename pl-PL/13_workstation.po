msgid "X11 is the graphical system most widely used on Unix-like systems (also available, in addition to the native system, for Windows and Mac OS). Strictly speaking, the “X11” term only refers to a protocol specification, but it is also used to refer to the implementation in practice."
msgstr ""

msgid "X11 had a rough start, but the 1990's saw XFree86 emerge as the reference implementation because it was free software, portable, and maintained by a collaborative community. However, the rate of evolution slowed down near the end when the software only gained new drivers. That situation, along with a very controversial license change, led to the X.org fork in 2004. This is now the reference implementation, and Debian <emphasis role=\"distribution\">Jessie</emphasis> uses X.org version 7.7."
msgstr ""

msgid "Current versions of X.org are able to autodetect the available hardware: this applies to the video card and the monitor, as well as keyboards and mice; in fact, it is so convenient that the package no longer even creates a <filename>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</filename> configuration file. This is all made possible by features provided by the Linux kernel (in particular for keyboards and mice), by having each driver list the video cards it supports, and by using the DDC protocol to fetch monitor characteristics."

The former is a generic driver that should work everywhere, but with limited capabilities (fewer available resolutions, no hardware acceleration for games and visual effects for the desktop, and so on) while the latter works on top of the kernel's framebuffer device. The X server writes its messages to the <filename>/var/log/Xorg.0.log</filename> log file, which is where one would look to know what driver is currently in use.

msgstr ""

msgid "Some video card makers (most notably nVidia) refuse to publish the hardware specifications that would be required to implement good free drivers. They do, however, provide proprietary drivers that allow using their hardware. This policy is nefarious, because even when the provided driver exists, it is usually not as polished as it should be; more importantly, it does not necessarily follow the X.org updates, which may prevent the latest available driver from loading correctly (or at all). We cannot condone this behavior, and we recommend you avoid these makers and favor more cooperative manufacturers."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you still end up with such a card, you will find the required packages in the <emphasis>non-free</emphasis> section: <emphasis role=\"pkg\">nvidia-glx</emphasis> for nVidia cards, and <emphasis role=\"pkg\">fglrx-driver</emphasis> for some ATI cards. Both cases require matching kernel modules. Building these modules can be automated by installing the <emphasis role=\"pkg\">nvidia-kernel-dkms</emphasis> (for nVidia), or <emphasis role=\"pkg\">fglrx-modules-dkms</emphasis> (for ATI) packages."
msgstr ""

msgid "The “nouveau” project aims to develop a free software driver for nVidia cards. As of <emphasis role=\"distribution\">Jessie</emphasis>, its feature set does not match the proprietary driver. In the developers' defense, we should mention that the required information can only be gathered by reverse engineering, which makes things difficult. The free driver for ATI video cards, called “radeon”, is much better in that regard although it often requires a non-free firmware."

It also allows reducing, restoring, maximizing, and hiding windows. Most window managers also provide a menu that pops up when the desktop is clicked in a specific way. This menu provides the means to close the window manager session, starting new applications, and in some cases, change to another window manager (if installed)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Older computers may, however, have a hard time running heavyweight graphical desktop environments. In these cases, a lighter configuration should be used. “Light” (or small footprint) window managers include WindowMaker (in the <emphasis role=\"pkg\">wmaker</emphasis> package), Afterstep, fvwm, icewm, blackbox, fluxbox, or openbox.

msgstr ""

msgid "For each window manager, the relevant package therefore registers the appropriate command as a possible choice for <command>x-window-manager</command> along with an associated priority. Barring explicit configuration by the administrator, this priority allows picking the best installed window manager when the generic command is run."
msgstr ""

msgid "Both the registration of commands and the explicit configuration involve the <command>update-alternatives</command> script. Choosing where a symbolic command points at is a simple matter of running <command>update-alternatives --config <replaceable>symbolic-command</replaceable></command>. The <command>update-alternatives</command> script creates (and maintains) symbolic links in the <filename>/etc/alternatives/</filename> directory, which in turn references the location of the executable. As time passes, packages are installed or removed, and/or the administrator makes explicit changes to the configuration. When a package providing an alternative is removed, the alternative automatically goes to the next best choice among the remaining possible commands."

It takes the same overall approach based on the standard development model for free software. The software itself has kept evolving after the SourceForge code went proprietary. Its initial authors, VA Software, decided not to release any more free versions. The same happened again when the first fork (GForge) followed the same path. Since various people and organizations have participated in development, the current FusionForge also includes features targeting a more traditional approach to development, as well as projects not purely concerned with software development."

The GNOME and KDE projects are still working on their offerings (GNOME Office and Calligra Suite), and the friendly competition leads to interesting results. For instance, the Gnumeric spreadsheet (part of GNOME Office) is even better than OpenOffice.org/Libre Office in some domains, notably the precision of its calculations. On the word processing front, the OpenOffice.org and Libre Office suites still lead the way."
