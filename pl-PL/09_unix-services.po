msgid "When you boot the computer, the many messages scrolling by on the console display many automatic initializations and configurations that are being executed. Sometimes you may wish to slightly alter how this stage works, which means that you need to understand it well. That is the purpose of this section."
msgstr "Kiedy bootujesz komputer, masa wiadomości przewijających się przez konsole ukazuje wykonywane automatyczne inicjalizacje i konfiguracje. Czasami chcesz nieco wpłynąć na działanie tego etapu, co oznacza, ze musisz go dobrze zrozumieć. To jest właśnie celem tej części książki."

msgid "First, the BIOS takes control of the computer, detects the disks, loads the <emphasis>Master Boot Record</emphasis>, and executes the bootloader. The bootloader takes over, finds the kernel on the disk, loads and executes it. The kernel is then initialized, and starts to search for and mount the partition containing the root filesystem, and finally executes the first program — <command>init</command>. Frequently, this “root partition” and this <command>init</command> are, in fact, located in a virtual filesystem that only exists in RAM (hence its name, “initramfs”, formerly called “initrd” for “initialization RAM disk”). This filesystem is loaded in memory by the bootloader, often from a file on a hard drive or from the network. It contains the bare minimum required by the kernel to load the “true” root filesystem: this may be driver modules for the hard drive, or other devices without which the system cannot boot, or, more frequently, initialization scripts and modules for assembling RAID arrays, opening encrypted partitions, activating LVM volumes, etc. Once the root partition is mounted, the initramfs hands over control to the real init, and the machine goes back to the standard boot process."

msgstr ""

msgid "<emphasis role=\"pkg\">file-rc</emphasis> is a boot system with a very simple process. It keeps the principle of runlevels, but replaces the directories and symbolic links with a configuration file, which indicates to <command>init</command> the processes that must be started and their launch order."
msgstr "<emphasis role=\"pkg\">file-rc</emphasis> jest systemem bootującym z bardzo prostym procesem. Podtrzymuje zasadę poziomów działania, ale zamienia słownikowe i symboliczne dowiązania do pliku konfiguracyjnego, który wskazuje na procesy  <command>init</command>, które muszą zostać wykonane i ustanawia ich kolejność."

msgid "The <command>upstart</command> system is still not perfectly tested on Debian. It is event based: init scripts are no longer executed in a sequential order but in response to events such as the completion of another script upon which they are dependent. This system, started by Ubuntu, is present in Debian <emphasis role=\"distribution\">Jessie</emphasis>, but is not the default; it comes, in fact, as a replacement for <emphasis role=\"pkg\">sysvinit</emphasis>, and one of the tasks launched by <command>upstart</command> is to launch the scripts written for traditional systems, especially those from the <emphasis role=\"pkg\">sysv-rc</emphasis> package."

msgid "In some configurations, the BIOS may be configured not to execute the MBR, but to seek its equivalent on the network, making it possible to build computers without a hard drive, or which are completely reinstalled on each boot. This option is not available on all hardware and it generally requires an appropriate combination of BIOS and network card."
msgstr "W niektórych konfiguracjach, BIOS może być ustawiony tak, aby nie uruchamiać głównego sektora rozruchowego, ale szukać jego równoważności w sieci, stwarzając możliwość działania komputerów bez dysków twardych, albo takie, które będą całkowicie reinstalowane po każdej inicjalizacji systemu."

msgstr "<primary>proces</primary>"

msgid "A process is the representation in memory of a running program. It includes all of the information necessary for the proper execution of the software (the code itself, but also the data that it has in memory, the list of files that it has opened, the network connections it has established, etc.). A single program may be instantiated into several processes, not necessarily running under different user IDs."
msgstr "Proces jest reprezentacją uruchomionego programu w pamięci komputera. Zawiera wszystkie informacje niezbędne do poprawnego uruchomienia oprogramowania(kod sam w sobie, ale także dane, które ma w pamięci, listę otwartych plików, ustanowionych połączeń w sieci itd.).

msgid "By convention, the first process that is booted is the <command>init</command> program (which is a symbolic link to <filename>/lib/systemd/systemd</filename> by default). However, it is possible to pass an <literal>init</literal> option to the kernel indicating a different program."

msgid "Any person who is able to access the computer can press the <keycap>Reset</keycap> button, and thus reboot it. Then, at the bootloader's prompt, it is possible to pass the <literal>init=/bin/sh</literal> option to the kernel to gain root access without knowing the administrator's password."
msgstr "Każdy człowiek, który ma bezpośredni dostęp do komputera może wcisnąć klawisz <keycap>Reset</keycap> i spowodować ponowny rozruch systemu. Następnie przy zgłoszeniu się bootloadera, możliwe jest pominięcie opcji  <literal>init=/bin/sh</literal>w jądrze systemu, aby zdobyć dostęp do roota bez znajomości hasła administratora systemu."

msgid "To prevent this, you can protect the bootloader itself with a password. You might also think about protecting access to the BIOS (a password protection mechanism is almost always available), without which a malicious intruder could still boot the machine on a removable media containing its own Linux system, which they could then use to access data on the computer's hard drives."
msgstr "Aby temu zapobiec, możesz zabezpieczyć sam bootloader hasłem. Możesz także pomyśleć by zabezpieczyć BIOS(prawie zawsze istnieje możliwość utworzenia hasła), bez którego złośliwy intruz może nadal zbootować system na nośniku wymiennym zawierającym swojego własnego Linuxa, którego może użyć by dostać się do danych na Twoim dysku."

msgid "Finally, be aware that most BIOS have a generic password available. Initially intended for troubleshooting for those who have forgotten their password, these passwords are now public and available on the Internet (see for yourself by searching for “generic BIOS passwords” in a search engine). All of these protections will thus impede unauthorized access to the machine without being able to completely prevent it. There is no reliable way to protect a computer if the attacker can physically access it; they could dismount the hard drives to connect them to a computer under their own control anyway, or even steal the entire machine, or erase the BIOS memory to reset the password…"

msgid "Systemd executes several processes, in charge of setting up the system: keyboard, drivers, filesystems, network, services. It does this while keeping a global view of the system as a whole, and the requirements of the components. Each component is described by a “unit file” (sometimes more); the general syntax is derived from the widely-used “*.ini files“ syntax, with <literal><replaceable>key</replaceable> = <replaceable>value</replaceable></literal> pairs grouped between <literal>[<replaceable>section</replaceable>]</literal> headers. Unit files are stored under <filename>/lib/systemd/system/</filename> and <filename>/etc/systemd/system/</filename>; they come in several flavours, but we will focus on “services” and “targets” here."
msgstr ""

msgid "A systemd “service file” describes a process managed by systemd. It contains roughly the same information as old-style init-scripts, but expressed in a declaratory (and much more concise) way. Systemd handles the bulk of the repetitive tasks (starting and stopping the process, checking its status, logging, dropping privileges, and so on), and the service file only needs to fill in the specifics of the process. For instance, here is the service file for SSH:"

"Restart=on-failure\n"
"\n"
"[Install]\n"
"WantedBy=multi-user.target\n"
"Alias=sshd.service"
msgstr ""

msgid "As you can see, there is very little code in there, only declarations. Systemd takes care of displaying progress reports, keeping track of the processes, and even restarting them when needed."
msgstr ""

msgid "A systemd “target file” describes a state of the system, where a set of services are known to be operational. It can be thought of as an equivalent of the old-style runlevel. One of the targets is <literal>local-fs.target</literal>; when it is reached, the rest of the system can assume that all local filesystems are mounted and accessible. Other targets include <literal>network-online.target</literal> and <literal>sound.target</literal>. The dependencies of a target can be listed either within the target file (in the <literal>Requires=</literal> line), or using a symbolic link to a service file in the <literal>/lib/systemd/system/<replaceable>targetname</replaceable>.target.wants/</literal> directory. For instance, <filename>/etc/systemd/system/printer.target.wants/</filename> contains a link to <filename>/lib/systemd/system/cups.service</filename>; systemd will therefore ensure CUPS is running in order to reach <literal>printer.target</literal>."
msgstr ""

msgid "Since unit files are declarative rather than scripts or programs, they cannot be run directly, and they are only interpreted by systemd; several utilities therefore allow the administrator to interact with systemd and control the state of the system and of each component."
msgstr ""

msgid "The first such utility is <command>systemctl</command>. When run without any arguments, it lists all the unit files known to systemd (except those that have been disabled), as well as their status. <command>systemctl status</command> gives a better view of the services, as well as the related processes. If given the name of a service (as in <command>systemctl status ntp.service</command>), it returns even more details, as well as the last few log lines related to the service (more on that later)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Starting a service by hand is a simple matter of running <command>systemctl start <replaceable>servicename</replaceable>.service</command>. As one can guess, stopping the service is done with <command>systemctl stop <replaceable>servicename</replaceable>.service</command>; other subcommands include <command>reload</command> and <command>restart</command>."
msgstr ""

msgid "To control whether a service is active (i.e. whether it will get started automatically on boot), use <command>systemctl enable <replaceable>servicename</replaceable>.service</command> (or <command>disable</command>). <command>is-enabled</command> allows checking the status of the service."
msgstr ""

msgid "An interesting feature of systemd is that it includes a logging component named <command>journald</command>. It comes as a complement to more traditional logging systems such as <command>syslogd</command>, but it adds interesting features such as a formal link between a service and the messages it generates, and the ability to capture error messages generated by its initialisation sequence. The messages can be displayed later on, with a little help from the <command>journalctl</command> command. Without any arguments, it simply spews all log messages that occurred since system boot; it will rarely be used in such a manner. Most of the time, it will be used with a service identifier:"

The static numbering of scripts is therefore no longer taken into consideration (but they must always have a name beginning with “S” followed by two digits and the actual name of the script used for the dependencies).

msgid "The <emphasis>hotplug</emphasis> kernel subsystem dynamically handles the addition and removal of devices, by loading the appropriate drivers and by creating the corresponding device files (with the help of <command>udevd</command>). With modern hardware and virtualization, almost everything can be hotplugged: from the usual USB/PCMCIA/IEEE 1394 peripherals to SATA hard drives, but also the CPU and the memory."
msgstr ""

msgid "The kernel has a database that associates each device ID with the required driver. This database is used during boot to load all the drivers for the peripheral devices detected on the different buses, but also when an additional hotplug device is connected. Once the device is ready for use, a message is sent to <command>udevd</command> so it will be able to create the corresponding entry in <filename>/dev/</filename>."

msgid "The Naming Problem"
msgstr ""

msgid "Before the appearance of hotplug connections, it was easy to assign a fixed name to a device. It was based simply on the position of the devices on their respective bus. But this is not possible when such devices can come and go on the bus. The typical case is the use of a digital camera and a USB key, both of which appear to the computer as disk drives. The first one connected may be <filename>/dev/sdb</filename> and the second <filename>/dev/sdc</filename> (with <filename>/dev/sda</filename> representing the computer's own hard drive). The device name is not fixed; it depends on the order in which devices are connected."
msgstr ""

msgid "Additionally, more and more drivers use dynamic values for devices' major/minor numbers, which makes it impossible to have static entries for the given devices, since these essential characteristics may vary after a reboot."
msgstr ""

msgid "<emphasis>udev</emphasis> was created precisely to solve this problem."
msgstr ""

msgid "<emphasis>IN PRACTICE</emphasis> Network card management"
msgstr ""

msgid "Many computers have multiple network cards (sometimes two wired interfaces and a wifi interface), and with <emphasis>hotplug</emphasis> support on most bus types, the Linux kernel does not guarantee fixed naming of network interfaces. But users who want to configure their network in <filename>/etc/network/interfaces</filename> need a fixed name!"
msgstr ""

msgid "It would be difficult to ask every user to create their own <emphasis>udev</emphasis> rules to address this problem. This is why <emphasis>udev</emphasis> was configured in a rather peculiar manner; on first boot (and, more generally, each time that a new network card appears) it uses the name of the network interface and its MAC address to create new rules that will reassign the same name on subsequent boots. These rules are stored in <filename>/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules</filename>."
msgstr ""

msgid "This mechanism has some side effects that you should know about. Let's consider the case of a computer that has only one PCI network card. The network interface is named <literal>eth0</literal>, logically. Now say the card breaks down, and the administrator replaces it; the new card will have a new MAC address. Since the old card was assigned the name, <literal>eth0</literal>, the new one will be assigned <literal>eth1</literal>, even though the <literal>eth0</literal> card is gone for good (and the network will not be functional because <filename>/etc/network/interfaces</filename> likely configures an <literal>eth0</literal> interface). In this case, it is enough to simply delete the <filename>/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules</filename> file before rebooting the computer. The new card will then be given the expected <literal>eth0</literal> name."
msgstr ""

msgid "How <emphasis>udev</emphasis> Works"
msgstr ""

msgid "When <emphasis>udev</emphasis> is notified by the kernel of the appearance of a new device, it collects various information on the given device by consulting the corresponding entries in <filename>/sys/</filename>, especially those that uniquely identify it (MAC address for a network card, serial number for some USB devices, etc.)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Armed with all of this information, <emphasis>udev</emphasis> then consults all of the rules contained in <filename>/etc/udev/rules.d/</filename> and <filename>/lib/udev/rules.d/</filename>. In this process it decides how to name the device, what symbolic links to create (to give it alternative names), and what commands to execute. All of these files are consulted, and the rules are all evaluated sequentially (except when a file uses “GOTO” directives). Thus, there may be several rules that correspond to a given event."
msgstr ""

msgid "The syntax of rules files is quite simple: each row contains selection criteria and variable assignments. The former are used to select events for which there is a need to react, and the latter defines the action to take. They are all simply separated with commas, and the operator implicitly differentiates between a selection criterion (with comparison operators, such as <literal>==</literal> or <literal>!=</literal>) or an assignment directive (with operators such as <literal>=</literal>, <literal>+=</literal> or <literal>:=</literal>)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Comparison operators are used on the following variables:"
msgstr ""

msgid "<literal>KERNEL</literal>: the name that the kernel assigns to the device;"
msgstr ""

msgid "<literal>ACTION</literal>: the action corresponding to the event (“add” when a device has been added, “remove” when it has been removed);"
msgstr ""

msgid "<literal>DEVPATH</literal>: the path of the device's <filename>/sys/</filename> entry;"
msgstr ""

msgid "<literal>SUBSYSTEM</literal>: the kernel subsystem which generated the request (there are many, but a few examples are “usb”, “ide”, “net”, “firmware”, etc.);"
msgstr ""

msgid "<literal>ATTR{<replaceable>attribute</replaceable>}</literal>: file contents of the <replaceable>attribute</replaceable> file in the <filename>/sys/<replaceable>$devpath</replaceable>/</filename> directory of the device. This is where you find the MAC address and other bus specific identifiers;"
msgstr ""

msgid "<literal>KERNELS</literal>, <literal>SUBSYSTEMS</literal> and <literal>ATTRS{<replaceable>attributes</replaceable>}</literal> are variations that will try to match the different options on one of the parent devices of the current device;"
msgstr ""

msgid "<literal>PROGRAM</literal>: delegates the test to the indicated program (true if it returns 0, false if not). The content of the program's standard output is stored so that it can be reused by the <literal>RESULT</literal> test;"
msgstr ""

msgid "<literal>RESULT</literal>: execute tests on the standard output stored during the last call to <literal>PROGRAM</literal>."
msgstr ""

msgid "The right operands can use pattern expressions to match several values at the same time. For instance, <literal>*</literal> matches any string (even an empty one); <literal>?</literal> matches any character, and <literal>[]</literal> matches the set of characters listed between the square brackets (or the opposite thereof if the first character is an exclamation point, and contiguous ranges of characters are indicated like <literal>a-z</literal>)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Regarding the assignment operators, <literal>=</literal> assigns a value (and replaces the current value); in the case of a list, it is emptied and contains only the value assigned. <literal>:=</literal> does the same, but prevents later changes to the same variable. As for <literal>+=</literal>, it adds an item to a list. The following variables can be changed:"
msgstr ""

msgid "<literal>NAME</literal>: the device filename to be created in <filename>/dev/</filename>. Only the first assignment counts; the others are ignored;"
msgstr ""

msgid "<literal>SYMLINK</literal>: the list of symbolic links that will point to the same device;"
msgstr ""

msgid "<literal>OWNER</literal>, <literal>GROUP</literal> and <literal>MODE</literal> define the user and group that owns the device, as well as the associated permission;"
msgstr ""

msgid "<literal>RUN</literal>: the list of programs to execute in response to this event."
msgstr ""

msgid "The values assigned to these variables may use a number of substitutions:"
msgstr ""

msgid "<literal>$kernel</literal> or <literal>%k</literal>: equivalent to <literal>KERNEL</literal>;"
msgstr ""

msgid "<literal>$number</literal> or <literal>%n</literal>: the order number of the device, for example, for <literal>sda3</literal>, it would be “3”;"
msgstr ""

msgid "<literal>$devpath</literal> or <literal>%p</literal>: equivalent to <literal>DEVPATH</literal>;"
msgstr ""

msgid "<literal>$attr{<replaceable>attribute</replaceable>}</literal> or <literal>%s{<replaceable>attribute</replaceable>}</literal>: equivalent to <literal>ATTRS{<replaceable>attribute</replaceable>}</literal>;"
