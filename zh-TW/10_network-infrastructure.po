msgid "A gateway is a system linking several networks. This term often refers to a local network's “exit point” on the mandatory path to all external IP addresses. The gateway is connected to each of the networks it links together, and acts as a router to convey IP packets between its various interfaces."

msgid "Most networks nowadays use the IP protocol (<emphasis>Internet Protocol</emphasis>). This protocol segments the transmitted data into limited-size packets. Each packet contains, in addition to its payload data, a number of details required for its proper routing."
msgstr "今天，大部份的網路使用 IP 通信協定 (<emphasis>Internet Protocol</emphasis>)。這種協定把傳輸資料切割成小小的封包。除了實際傳輸的資料外，每個封包還包括必備的路由資訊。"

msgid "Many programs do not handle the individual packets themselves, even though the data they transmit does travel over IP; they often use TCP (<emphasis>Transmission Control Protocol</emphasis>). TCP is a layer over IP allowing the establishment of connections dedicated to data streams between two points. The programs then only see an entry point into which data can be fed with the guarantee that the same data exits without loss (and in the same sequence) at the exit point at the other end of the connection. Although many kinds of errors can happen in the lower layers, they are compensated by TCP: lost packets are retransmitted, and packets arriving out of order (for example, if they used different paths) are re-ordered appropriately."
msgstr "即使在 IP 上傳輸資料，大部份程式都不處理個別的封包問題；他們通常使用 TCP (<emphasis>Transmission Control Protocol</emphasis>)。TCP 是 IP 的上層，為專屬的資料流建立兩點間的連結。程式祗看到資料進來的款目，並保證同樣的資料無誤 (且以同樣順序) 流到另端連結的出口。在較低層可能發生多種錯誤，都可以被 TCP 補償：重送失去的封包、重組到達的封包 (例如，經由不同路徑送到) 的順序。"

msgid "Another protocol relying on IP is UDP (<emphasis>User Datagram Protocol</emphasis>). In contrast to TCP, it is packet-oriented. Its goals are different: the purpose of UDP is only to transmit one packet from an application to another. The protocol does not try to compensate for possible packet loss on the way, nor does it ensure that packets are received in the same order as were sent. The main advantage to this protocol is that the latency is greatly improved, since the loss of a single packet does not delay the receiving of all following packets until the lost one is retransmitted."
msgstr "另個在 IP 上的協定是 UDP (<emphasis>User Datagram Protocol</emphasis>)。與 TCP 不同，它是封包導向的。它的目標不同：UDP 的目的是在應用程式間傳輸封包。此協定不補償封包的遺漏，也不在意封包依序到達。此協定的主要優點是，大幅改善延遲的問題，遺漏的封包不影響接收後續封包，並且持續重送該遺漏的封包。"

msgid "TCP and UDP both involve ports, which are “extension numbers” for establishing communication with a given application on a machine. This concept allows keeping several different communications in parallel with the same correspondent, since these communications can be distinguished by the port number."
msgstr "TCP 和 UDP 都涉及封包，也就是以 \"分機號碼\" 模式在機器內的程式建立連結。此做法允許在同個通訊中建立多個平行的管道，因為它們以不同的埠號區分之。"

msgid "Some of these port numbers — standardized by the IANA (<emphasis>Internet Assigned Numbers Authority</emphasis>) — are “well-known” for being associated with network services. For instance, TCP port 25 is generally used by the email server. <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers\" />"
msgstr "部份埠號 — 由 IANA (<emphasis>Internet Assigned Numbers Authority</emphasis>) 規範 — 以與網路服務相關而 “知名”。例如，TCP 埠號 25 係供電子郵件伺服器使用。<ulink type=\"block\" url=\"http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers\" />"

msgid "When a local network uses a private address range (not routable on the Internet), the gateway needs to implement <emphasis>address masquerading</emphasis> so that the machines on the network can communicate with the outside world. The masquerading operation is a kind of proxy operating on the network level: each outgoing connection from an internal machine is replaced with a connection from the gateway itself (since the gateway does have an external, routable address), the data going through the masqueraded connection is sent to the new one, and the data coming back in reply is sent through to the masqueraded connection to the internal machine. The gateway uses a range of dedicated TCP ports for this purpose, usually with very high numbers (over 60000). Each connection coming from an internal machine then appears to the outside world as a connection coming from one of these reserved ports."
msgstr "區域網路接在私人網址範圍內 (不在網路網路的路由上)，閘道器就需要 <emphasis>位址掩蔽</emphasis> 讓其經由網路與外界溝通。掩蔽作業是網路層次的代理工作：內部機器，都被閘道器取代 (因為閘道器有外部的路由位址)，藉由掩蔽連結，資料送出出去，進來的資料經由掩蔽連結至內部機器。閘道器以指定的 TCP 埠執行此工作，通常是較高的號碼 (超過 60000)。對外部而言，經由內部機器的連結，就是來自此等保留埠號。"

msgid "The gateway can also perform two kinds of <emphasis>network address translation</emphasis> (or NAT for short). The first kind, <emphasis>Destination NAT</emphasis> (DNAT) is a technique to alter the destination IP address (and/or the TCP or UDP port) for a (generally) incoming connection. The connection tracking mechanism also alters the following packets in the same connection to ensure continuity in the communication. The second kind of NAT is <emphasis>Source NAT</emphasis> (SNAT), of which <emphasis>masquerading</emphasis> is a particular case; SNAT alters the source IP address (and/or the TCP or UDP port) of a (generally) outgoing connection. As for DNAT, all the packets in the connection are appropriately handled by the connection tracking mechanism. Note that NAT is only relevant for IPv4 and its limited address space; in IPv6, the wide availability of addresses greatly reduces the usefulness of NAT by allowing all “internal” addresses to be directly routable on the Internet (this does not imply that internal machines are accessible, since intermediary firewalls can filter traffic)."
msgstr "閘道器有兩種 <emphasis>網路位址轉換</emphasis> (英文縮寫 NAT) 的功能。第一種是 <emphasis>目的 NAT</emphasis> (DNAT)，改變封包目的 IP 位址 (與 TCP 或 UDP 埠)。連結追蹤機制同時改變後續封包的連結。第二種 NAT 是 <emphasis>來源 NAT</emphasis> (SNAT)，其中的 <emphasis>偽裝</emphasis> 是特例之一；SNAT 改變出去連結的來源 IP 位址 (與 TCP 或 UDP 埠)。如同 DNAT，所有的封包由連結追蹤機制處理。NAT 祗用於 IPv4 及其限制的位址空間；在 IPv6 內，其寬廣的位址技術允許直接在網際網路路由 (並不表示可以近用內部機器，因為防火牆可以過濾流量) 減少 NAT 的用途。"

The two keys are closely linked to each other, and their mathematical properties are such that a message encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted by someone knowing the private key, which ensures confidentiality. In the opposite direction, a message encrypted with the private key can be decrypted by anyone knowing the public key, which allows authenticating the origin of a message since only someone with access to the private key could generate it. When associated with a digital hash function (MD5, SHA1, or a more recent variant), this leads to a signature mechanism that can be applied to any message."
msgstr "RSA 演算法是使用廣泛的公鑰加密法。以 “密鑰配對” 法比對私鑰與公鑰。兩鑰密切連在一起，以公鑰演算加密的訊息，祗能被知道私鑰的人解開，以保障其安全。反之亦然，以私鑰加密的訊息，祗能被公鑰解開，也就是讓擁有私鑰的人，可以向指定的社群發出訊息。以數位雜湊 (MD5、SHA1、或其他) 方式演算，適用於任何簽名機制的訊息。"

msgid "However, anyone can create a key pair, store any identity on it, and pretend to be the identity of their choice. One solution involves the concept of a <emphasis>Certification Authority</emphasis> (CA), formalized by the X.509 standard. This term covers an entity that holds a trusted key pair known as a <emphasis>root certificate</emphasis>. This certificate is only used to sign other certificates (key pairs), after proper steps have been undertaken to check the identity stored on the key pair. Applications using X.509 can then check the certificates presented to them, if they know about the trusted root certificates."
msgstr "任何人都可以新增密鑰配對。採用 <emphasis>授權認證</emphasis> (CA)，即 X.509 標準。此術語指的是擁有信任密鑰配對做為 <emphasis>root 認證</emphasis>。此認證祗用於簽署另個認證 (密鑰配對)，經過適當的程序，檢查儲存在密鑰配對的內容。使用 X.509 可以檢查其中的認證。"

Good practice therefore recommends creating a persistent virtual network interface, and configuring OpenVPN to use this pre-existing interface. This further allows choosing the name for this interface. To this end, <command>openvpn --mktun --dev vpn --dev-type tun</command> creates a virtual network interface named <literal>vpn</literal> with type <literal>tun</literal>; this command can easily be integrated in the firewall configuration script, or in an <literal>up</literal> directive of the <filename>/etc/network/interfaces</filename> file.

msgstr "實際上有兩種方法以 SSH 新增虛擬專屬網路。較舊的是以 SSH 建立 PPP 層連結。此方法在 HOWTO 文件詳細說明：<ulink type=\"block\" url=\"http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/ppp-ssh/\" />"

msgid "The second method is more recent, and was introduced with OpenSSH 4.3; it is now possible for OpenSSH to create virtual network interfaces (<literal>tun*</literal>) on both sides of an SSH connection, and these virtual interfaces can be configured exactly as if they were physical interfaces. The tunneling system must first be enabled by setting <literal>PermitTunnel</literal> to “yes” in the SSH server configuration file (<filename>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</filename>). When establishing the SSH connection, the creation of a tunnel must be explicitly requested with the <literal>-w any:any</literal> option (<literal>any</literal> can be replaced with the desired <literal>tun</literal> device number). This requires the user to have administrator privilege on both sides, so as to be able to create the network device (in other words, the connection must be established as root)."

msgstr "以 SSH 建立虛擬專屬網路的兩種方法都很直接。然而，它們提供的 VPN 不是最有效的；特別是，無法有效處理高階的流量。"

msgid "The explanation is that when a TCP/IP stack is encapsulated within a TCP/IP connection (for SSH), the TCP protocol is used twice, once for the SSH connection and once within the tunnel. This leads to problems, especially due to the way TCP adapts to network conditions by altering timeout delays. The following site describes the problem in more detail: <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"http://sites.inka.de/sites/bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.html\" /> VPNs over SSH should therefore be restricted to one-off tunnels with no performance constraints."
msgstr "當 TCP/IP 堆疊封裝在 TCP/IP 連結 (供 SSH 使用) 時，TCP 協定用了兩次，一次給 SSH 連結用，另一次使用於通道。問題就在這裡，尤其是 TCP 改變網路延遲時間的狀態。詳情見：<ulink type=\"block\" url=\"http://sites.inka.de/sites/bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.html\" /> 所以在 SSH 環境下的 VPN 應限制於無效能限制的一次性通道。"

Furthermore, <command>nmap</command> is able to identify some of these applications, sometimes even their version number.
