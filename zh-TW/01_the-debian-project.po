msgstr "近點看：Debian 不是縮寫字。其名稱是，真實的，結合兩個名字：Ian Murdock 與當時的女朋友 Debra。Debra + Ian = Debian。"

msgid "Debian is a GNU/Linux distribution. We will discuss what a distribution is in further detail in <xref linkend=\"sect.role-of-distributions\" />, but for now, we will simply state that it is a complete operating system, including software and systems for installation and management, all based on the Linux kernel and free software (especially those from the GNU project)."

msgid "When he created Debian, in 1993, under the leadership of the FSF, Ian Murdock had clear objectives, which he expressed in the <emphasis>Debian Manifesto</emphasis>. The free operating system that he sought would have to have two principal features. First, quality: Debian would be developed with the greatest care, to be worthy of the Linux kernel. It would also be a non-commercial distribution, sufficiently credible to compete with major commercial distributions. This double ambition would, in his eyes, only be achieved by opening the Debian development process just like that of Linux and the GNU project. Thus, peer review would continuously improve the product."
msgstr "1993年，在自由軟體基金會的領導下，建立 Debian時，Ian Murdock 已有明確的目標，列在 <emphasis>Debian 宣言</emphasis>。他所尋求的自由作業系統有兩個主要功能。第一，品質：以最高的標準建置 Debian，發揮 Linux 核心的價值。成為非商業性發行版，足以和主要的商業發行版競爭。從他的眼中，必須參照 Linux 與 GNU 計畫的開放模式，才能達成此等功能。因此，同儕評量成為改進的基礎。"

msgid "Ian Murdock, founder of the Debian project, was its first leader, from 1993 to 1996. After passing the baton to Bruce Perens, Ian took a less public role. He returned to working behind the scenes of the free software community, creating the Progeny company, with the intention of marketing a distribution derived from Debian. This venture was, sadly, a commercial failure, and development was abandoned. The company, after several years of scraping by, simply as a service provider, eventually filed for bankruptcy in April of 2007. Of the various projects initiated by Progeny, only <emphasis>discover</emphasis> still remains. It is an automatic hardware detection tool."
msgstr "Ian Murdock 創立 Debian 計畫，1993年至1996年的第一任領導者。然後交棒給 Bruce Perens，Ian 扮演較不公開的角色。回到自由軟體社群的幕後，創立 Progeny 公司，意圖行銷 Debian 的衍生版。很不幸，此創投失敗、最後放棄了。做為服務供應者，掙扎幾年後，在 2007 年4月宣告破産。祗有 <emphasis>discover</emphasis> 計畫還活著。它是自動偵測硬體的工具。"

msgid "Debian, remaining true to its initial principles, has had so much success that, today, it has reached a tremendous size. The 12 architectures offered cover 10 hardware architectures and 2 kernels (Linux and FreeBSD, although the FreeBSD-based ports are not part of the set of officially supported architectures). Furthermore, with more than 21,000 source packages, the available software can meet almost any need that one could have, whether at home or in the enterprise."
msgstr "Debian 仍堅持初衷，持續發展至今天的規模。成為以12個架構涵蓋10個硬體的兩個核心 (Linux 與 FreeBSD，雖然 FreeBSD 不是官方支持的架構)。尤有甚者，其 21,000 多個原始套件幾乎適用任何需求，家用或企業用。"

msgid "The sheer size of the distribution can be inconvenient: it is really unreasonable to distribute 84 CD-ROMs to install a complete version on a standard PC… This is why Debian is increasingly considered as a “meta-distribution”, from which one extracts more specific distributions intended for a particular public: Debian-Desktop for traditional office use, Debian-Edu for education and pedagogical use in an academic environment, Debian-Med for medical applications, Debian-Junior for young children, etc. A more complete list of the subprojects can be found in the section dedicated to that purpose, see <xref linkend=\"sect.sub-projects\" />."
msgstr "發行版的規模很不方便：需要 84 CD-ROM 才能在標準的 PC 安裝完整的版本 … 所以 Debian 採用 '超發行版' 模式，抽取部份內容形成特別的發行版：Debian-Desktop 供傳統的辦公室使用、 Debian-Edu 供學術環境的教育與教學使用、Debian-Med 供醫學使用、Debian-Junior 供青少年使用等。完整的清單，參見 <xref linkend=\"sect.sub-projects\" />."

msgid "These partial views of Debian are organized in a well-defined framework, thus guaranteeing hassle-free compatibility between the various “sub-distributions”. All of them follow the general planning for release of new versions. And since they build on the same foundations, they can be easily extended, completed, and personalized with applications available in the Debian repositories."

Each programming language has a specific compiler to execute this operation (for example, <command>gcc</command> for the C programming language)."

msgid "Debian follows all of the principles of Free Software, and its new versions are not released until they are ready. Developers are not forced by some set schedule to rush to meet an arbitrary deadline. People frequently complain of the long time between Debian's stable releases, but this caution also ensures Debian's legendary reliability: long months of testing are indeed necessary for the full distribution to receive the “stable” label."
msgstr "Debian 遵守自由軟體的原則，準備妥當才釋出新版本。沒有釋出新版本的固定期限。很多人抱怨 Debian 穩定版的間隔太長，但此現象確保 Debian 的穩定性：長期的測試是 '穩定' 標籤的保證。"

While initially created specifically for the Debian project, this association now hosts other free software projects, especially the PostgreSQL database, Freedesktop.org (project for standardization of various parts of modern graphical desktop environments, such as GNOME and KDE), and the Libre Office office suite. <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"http://www.spi-inc.org/\" />"
msgstr "Debian 未擁有任何以其為名的伺服器，因為它祗是 <emphasis>公共利益的軟體</emphasis> 協會下的一個計畫，公共利益的軟體 SPI 才是管理與經費來源 (捐贈、購買硬體等) 的單位。原先為了 Debian 計畫而成立，此協會目前已主持多個軟體計畫，包括 PostgreSQL 資料庫、Freedesktop.org (標準化當代圖形桌面環境的計畫，包括 GNOME 與 KDE)、與 Libre Office 生產軟體套件。<ulink type=\"block\" url=\"http://www.spi-inc.org/\" />"

msgid "In addition to SPI, various local associations collaborate closely with Debian in order to generate funds for Debian, without centralizing everything in the USA: they are known as “Trusted Organizations” in the Debian jargon. This setup avoids prohibitive international transfer costs, and fits well with the decentralized nature of the project."
msgstr "在公共利益的軟體協會 SPI 之外，還有很多協會與 Debian 密切合作為其募款，不必把重心全部放在 USA：以 Debian 的話語來說就是 '信任的組織'。此做法避免國際轉帳的成本，也符合此計畫去中央化的本質。"

To become a Debian developer, any candidate must confirm and prove their support and adherence to the principles established in the project's Foundation Documents."
msgstr "釋出幾年後，Debian 整理其做為自由軟體計畫應遵守的原則。確保其成員都能夠朝著同個方向前進。成為 Debian 發展者之前，必須確認且證明其對於 Debian 基金會文件的支援與執著。"

msgid "The development process is constantly debated, but these Foundation Documents are widely and consensually supported, thus rarely change. The Debian constitution also offers other guarantees for their stability: a three-quarters qualified majority is required to approve any amendment."

msgstr "此計畫也稱為 '社群契約'。這份文件怎麼和作業系統的發展扯上關係？很簡單：Debian 為使用者而存在，所以，從大範圍來說，就是為社會。此契約綜合計畫的承諾。詳情如下："

msgid "The first version of the Debian Social Contract said “Debian Will Remain 100% Free <emphasis>Software</emphasis>”. The disappearance of this word (with the ratification of Version 1.1 of the contract in April of 2004) indicates the will to achieve freedom, not only in software, but also in the documentation and any other element that Debian wishes to provide within its operating system."
msgstr "第一版的 Debian 社群契約提及 'Debian 永遠是 100% 的自由 <emphasis>軟體</emphasis>'。後來少了一個字 (2004年4月 1.1 版批次此變動) 表示其目標是自由，不祗是軟體還包括 Debian 希望透過其作業系統提供的其他元素也是自由的。"

msgid "This change, which was only intended as editorial, has, in reality, had numerous consequences, especially with the removal of some problematic documentation. Furthermore, the increasing use of firmware in drivers poses problems: many are non-free, yet they are necessary for proper operation of the corresponding hardware."
msgstr "此改變，雖然祗是編輯上的，實際上，卻產生很多影響，特別是移除很多有問題的文件。尤其是，驅動程式的韌體造成的問題：很多是不自由的，卻是相對硬體不可或缺的一部份。"

msgid "We will give back to the free software community."
msgstr "我們將回報自由軟體社羣。"

msgid "Any improvement contributed by the Debian project to a work integrated in the distribution is sent back to the author of the work (called “upstream”). In general, Debian will cooperate with the community rather than work in isolation."

msgid "The term “upstream author” means the author(s)/developer(s) of a work, those who write and develop it. On the other hand, a “Debian developer” uses an existing work to make it into a Debian package (the term “Debian maintainer” is better suited)."
msgstr "'上游著者' 係指發展作品的人，撰寫與發展該作品的人。另一種是 'Debian 發展者'，把既有的作品納入 Debian 套件 ('Debian 維護者' 或許是更適合的術語)。"

msgid "In practice, the distinction is often not as clear-cut. The Debian maintainer may write a patch, which benefits all users of the work. In general, Debian encourages those in charge of a package in Debian to get involved in “upstream” development as well (they become, then, contributors, without being confined to the role of simple users of a program)."
msgstr "實務上，其區別並不明顯。Debian 維護者可能撰寫補丁，讓使用者受益。一般來說，Debian 鼓勵負責包裝套件的人也參與 '上游' 的發展 (然後，他們成為貢獻者，不必自我設限為程式的使用者)。"

msgid "We will not hide problems."

msgid "Our priorities are our users and free software."
msgstr "優先考慮我們的使用者及自由軟體。"

msgid "This commitment is more difficult to define. Debian imposes, thus, a bias when a decision must be made, and will discard an easy solution for the developers that will jeopardize the user experience, opting for a more elegant solution, even if it is more difficult to implement. This means to take into account, as a priority, the interests of the users and free software."
msgstr "很難定義此承諾。從某個角度來說，Debian 的決定都是有主見的，廢止發展者提出的輕鬆解決方案若有礙使用者，轉而採用複雜難以執行的。也就是說，使用者與自由軟體的利益，放在第一位。"

msgid "Works that do not meet our free software standards."
msgstr "不符合我們自由軟體規範的作品。"

msgid "Debian accepts and understands that users may want to use some non-free programs. That's why the project allows usage of parts of its infrastructure to distribute Debian packages of non-free software that can safely be redistributed."

msgstr "Debian 社群經常爭論納入不自由軟體的結構 (即 '不自由' 區塊，見邊欄 <xref linkend=\"sidebar.sections\" />)。"

msgid "Detractors argue that it turns people away from free software equivalents, and contradicts the principle of serving only the free software cause. Supporters flatly state that most of the non-free packages are “nearly free”, and held back by only one or two annoying restrictions (the most common being the prohibition against commercial usage of the software). By distributing these works in the non-free branch, we indirectly explain to the author that their creation would be better known and more widely used if they could be included in the main section. They are, thus, politely invited to alter their license to serve this purpose."
msgstr "批評者認為等同於把人驅離自由軟體，違反祗服務自由軟體的原則。支持者則指出大部份的不自由套件已 '接近自由'，祗多了一兩個惱人的限制 (最常見的是禁止商業使用)。在不自由區塊發行這些作品，我們向著者解釋被納入的作品可擴大其知名度與散布面。然後，客氣地請求變更授權以達成其目標。"

msgid "After a first, unfruitful attempt in 2004, the complete removal of the non-free section is unlikely to return to the agenda, especially since it contains many useful documents that were moved simply because they did not meet the new requirements for the main section. This is especially the case for certain software documentation files issued by the GNU project (in particular, Emacs and Make)."
msgstr "經過 2004 不成功的嚐試後，移除非自由區塊並沒有達成目標，尤其被移除很多有用的文件。特別是 GNU 計畫內的若干軟體文件 (指的是 Emacs 和 Make)。"

msgid "The GNU GPL, used and promoted by the FSF (Free Software Foundation), is the most common. Its main feature is that it also applies to any derived work that is redistributed: a program incorporating or using GPL code can only be distributed according to its terms. It prohibits, thus, any reuse in a proprietary application. This poses serious problems for the reuse of GPL code in free software incompatible with this license. As such, it is sometimes impossible to link a program published under another free software license with a library distributed under the GPL. On the other hand, this license is very solid in American law: FSF lawyers have participated in the drafting thereof, and have often forced violators to reach an amicable agreement with the FSF without going to court. <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html\" />"

Copyleft imposes preservation of all initial liberties upon distribution of an original or modified version of a work (usually a program). It is, thus, not possible to distribute a program as proprietary software if it is derived from code from a copyleft released program."

However, developers annually elect a “leader” to represent them in meetings, and ensure internal coordination between varying teams. This election is always a period of intense discussions.

Certain themes are more frequently subject to polemics than others (the choice of text editor, “do you prefer <command>vi</command> or <command>emacs</command>?”, is an old favorite). The matters often provoke very rapid e-mail exchanges due to the sheer number of people with an opinion on the matter (everyone) and the very personal nature of such questions."

msgid "The <command>debian-installer</command>, designed to be extremely modular in order to be as generic as possible, targets the first objective. It covers a broad range of installation situations and in general, greatly facilitates the creation of a derivative installer corresponding to a particular case."

msgstr "模組化，讓情況很複雜，發展者極難發掘此工具；但在圖書或文字模式下，使用者的經驗仍然差不多。花了極大的力氣減少安裝所需的問題，特別感謝自動偵測硬體的軟體。"

msgid "It is interesting to note that distributions derived from Debian differ greatly on this aspect, and provide a more limited installer (often confined to the i386 or amd64 architectures), but more user-friendly for the uninitiated. On the other hand, they usually refrain from straying too far from package contents in order to benefit as much as possible from the vast range of software offered without causing compatibility problems."
msgstr "值得注意的是 Debian 的衍生發行版，以及對安裝器的限制 (通常祗限 i386 或 amd64 架構)，但對外行者應更為友善。從另個角度來說，不應離套件內容太遠以便儘量靠近軟體才不致發生相容性的問題。"

msgid "Quantitatively, Debian is undeniably the leader in this respect, with over 21,000 source packages.

As far as availability, everything is available on-line through many mirrors worldwide, with updates pushed out every six hours."
msgstr "以數量論，無疑地 Debian 居於領導地位，超過 21,000 隻原始套件。以質量論，Debian 的政策及釋出前的冗長測試期帶來穩定與一致。從近用的觀點論，所有的版本都可以經由全球多個鏡射站線上取得，每6小時就更新一次。"

msgid "Many retailers sell CD-ROMs on the Internet at a very low price (often at cost), the “images” for which are freely available for download. There is only one drawback: the low frequency of releases of new stable versions (their development sometimes takes more than two years), which delays the inclusion of new software."
msgstr "很多零售商以極低的價格 (通常是成本) 銷售 CD-ROM，雖然其 '映像檔' 可以自由下載。祗有一個缺點：穩定版的週期過長 (發展期常常超過2年)，以致延遲納入新軟體。"

msgid "Every newly updated package is updated on all Debian mirrors around the world within six hours. The users then test the corrections and search for other problems resulting from the modifications. Several updates may then occur rapidly. During these times, autobuilder robots come into action. Most frequently, the maintainer has only one traditional PC and has compiled their package on the amd64 (or i386) architecture; the autobuilders take over and automatically compile versions for all the other architectures. Some compilations may fail; the maintainer will then receive a bug report indicating the problem, which is then to be corrected in the next versions. When the bug is discovered by a specialist for the architecture in question, the bug report may come with a patch ready to use."
msgstr "更新的套件在六個小時內更新至全球的鏡射站。使用者測試修正後的套件並搜尋其他程式的可能錯誤。部份更新的套件動作更快。在這段時間內，啟用自動建立機器人。最常見的情況是，維護者祗有一部傳統的PC在amd64(或i386)架構下編譯其套件；然後由自動建立機器人接手處理其他架構。有些編譯可能失敗；維護者收到錯誤報告，然後在下個版本修正它。由專家發現的錯誤，，其錯誤報告可能與補丁同時出現。"

On the other hand, the script identifying the families of related packages works hard to create them (this would be an NP-complete problem, for which, fortunately, we know some good heuristics). This is why we can manually interact with and guide this script by suggesting groups of packages, or imposing the inclusion of certain packages in a group, even if this temporarily breaks some dependencies. This functionality is accessible to the Release Managers and their assistants."
msgstr "很有趣的原則，<emphasis role=\"distribution\">測試版</emphasis>應沒有實際的問題：套件的跨平台相依性很難獨立完成。套件彼此相依，必須同時殖入大量的套件，事實上很難同時殖入定期更新的套件。另一方面，很難製作用於辨認相關套件家族的腳本(這是NP完備的問題，還好我們知道若干路徑)。以手動方式與腳本互動並指引若干可能的套件，或納入指定套件於群組內，即使此方法打破若干相依性。這些功能由釋出經理及其團隊負責。"
