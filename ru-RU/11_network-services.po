msgid "The first question deals with the type of setup. Only two of the proposed answers are relevant in case of an Internet-connected server, “Internet site” and “Internet with smarthost”. The former is appropriate for a server that receives incoming email and sends outgoing email directly to its recipients, and is therefore well-adapted to the Falcot Corp case. The latter is appropriate for a server receiving incoming email normally, but that sends outgoing email through an intermediate SMTP server — the “smarthost” — rather than directly to the recipient's server. This is mostly useful for individuals with a dynamic IP address, since many email servers reject messages coming straight from such an IP address. In this case, the smarthost will usually be the ISP's SMTP server, which is always configured to accept email coming from the ISP's customers and forward it appropriately. This setup (with a smarthost) is also relevant for servers that are not permanently connected to the internet, since it avoids having to manage a queue of undeliverable messages that need to be retried later."

msgid "“Greylisting” is a filtering technique according to which a message is initially rejected with a temporary error code, and only accepted on a further try after some delay. This filtering is particularly efficient against spam sent by the many machines infected by worms and viruses, since this software rarely acts as a full SMTP agent (by checking the error code and retrying failed messages later), especially since many of the harvested addresses are really invalid and retrying would only mean losing time."

msgid "Postfix doesn't provide greylisting natively, but there is a feature by which the decision to accept or reject a given message can be delegated to an external program. The <emphasis role=\"pkg\">postgrey</emphasis> package contains just such a program, designed to interface with this access policy delegation service."

If so, Postgrey replies that the message should be accepted; if not, the reply indicates that the message should be temporarily rejected, and the triplet gets recorded in the database."

msgid "<emphasis>IN PRACTICE</emphasis> Shortcomings of greylisting"
msgstr ""

msgid "Theoretically, greylisting should only delay the first mail from a given sender to a given recipient, and the typical delay is in the order of minutes. Reality, however, can differ slightly. Some large ISPs use clusters of SMTP servers, and when a message is initially rejected, the server that retries the transmission may not be the same as the initial one. When that happens, the second server gets a temporary error message due to greylisting too, and so on; it may take several hours until transmission is attempted by a server that has already been involved, since SMTP servers usually increase the delay between retries at each failure."
msgstr ""

msgid "As a consequence, the incoming IP address may vary in time even for a single sender. But it goes further: even the sender address can change. For instance, many mailing-list servers encode extra information in the sender address so as to be able to handle error messages (known as <emphasis>bounces</emphasis>). Each new message sent to a mailing-list may then need to go through greylisting, which means it has to be stored (temporarily) on the sender's server. For very large mailing-lists (with tens of thousands of subscribers), this can soon become a problem."
msgstr ""

msgid "To mitigate these drawbacks, Postgrey manages a whitelist of such sites, and messages emanating from them are immediately accepted without going through greylisting.
